This game has a lot of sentimental value to me. I was about 14 at the time of purchase (2000). Really enjoyed unlocking the various islands in the game and building them out with seemingly endless possibilities.Aesthetically, there is something magical about the game. The island themes, rides, characters, color palette... all very intriguing. The art style is very cartoonish, but the gameplay is fairly realistic for a kids game - well balanced overall.This is a kids game that happens to be quite enjoyable even for adults due to the economic aspects of the game (i.e. managing the park, budgeting of staff training etc). I would recommend the game for early to mid teens and even adults looking for a temporary reprieve from reality. You won't be disappointed.

I am a software engineer by trade and while I agree that there are many variables at play with a 3D graphics game, the fact remains that it is the software company's responsibility to keep up with and comply to the different Windows and hardware platforms now available. My company does it, and any good game company will also, instead of pawning the blame on the hardware devices like EA does.  The game was fun on Me, fun enough that my son was extremely disheartened when it crashed repeatedly to the desktop on XP.  If you have XP, avoid it like the plague.

I guess you could say that this game was pretty much a dissappointment. I probably would have liked it more if I hadn't already bought Rollercoaster Tycoon (even though I'm not really a fan of that game, it's a LOT better than Sim Theme Park). I felt ripped off when I found out that there were only four theme parks to choose from, which made this a very short lasting game. Another major problem is - you can even build your own rides! Talk about cheap.Overall I give Sim Theme Park 2 stars, I gave the extra star because I probably would have liked it more if I got it before I got Rollercoaster Tycoon. Actually, this game is pretty good for all ages, it's just leaning a little more towards the younger kids, about I guess 6-12. If you want a game for older gamers, try Rollercoaster Tycoon. (I suggest that you just ditch the thought of buying a game about building amusement parks and get a game like The Sims or somehting).

Well there's a lot of ways this game could have been fun, IF only they had tried to put more into it, ok it says on the front box that you can chose from 4 different types of parks, In reality all the parks are the same,  just different animation, they all have a feris wheel, flying bird thing,  ect... The little talking advisor cannonball in the corner is insanely  inoying, and yet they make it so that you HAVE to have him to play the  game, other wise you'll not be able to get to problems in time. I mean are  programers IDIOTS?  Do they think that a little cannonball making bad  jokes and talking in the most annoying voice you have ever heard is what we  really want to have as an advisor? And why do they animate the kids and  everything in the cut sceens so unrealistic and stupid looking? In almost  every game programers feel that they need to make humans look as stupid as  possible, why? Its not funny, it demotes the animators intelegence. Anyways  the only thing thats really good about it is that you can ride your own  roller coasters, and you can turn the little cannonball guy off!  Although it will be harder to manage without him.

Sim Theme Park is Bullfrogs answer to the crown that was stolen from them by Roller Coaster Tycoon ( Bullfrog made the FIRST theme park developer game Theme Park) and comes close but falls short in many ways. First the  good stuff, STP has a fantastic graphic engine which makes the rides look  fantastic. The ability to ride the rides you make and walk through your  park is a major plus. But, the bad part is that the game lacks depth. Beat  the first park and the game is basicly over, you get 3 new parks but there  just the same rides with diffrent looks. The game requires a 3D card and  some hefty space on your computer to run some what smoothly. If your  looking for a great game, with more options and fun, that can run on your  computer no matter what go with Roller Coaster Tycoon and youll be hooked  and love every minute of it. By the way, dont pay 40 bucks for it either,  id sell my copy of it, without the box, just instructions and game for 20  or less. Only get this if your a diehard theme park fan or are looking for  a couple hours of graphic bliss.

BEFORE YOU WASTE YOUR MONEY listen to me! I being a Maxis fan and liking Rollercoaster Tycoon really wanted this game.It is a horrible game.  Possibly one of Maxis's worst games.  It is very slow if you have a computer like mine(not sure what are the megs of ram etc.).  Also like everyone else says it looks very cartoonish. I suggest you save your money and are very interested in buying a rollercoaster game buy Roller Coaster Tycoon or if you want to buy a Maxis game buy the Sim's or something like that.  once again DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!

I was really excited when this first came out and could not wait to get it.  ONce it arrived, I was pretty disappointed and frankly, was surprised that it came from the same people as SimCity!The game is slow and  choppy.  You can only start in one of two &quot;parks&quot; before going  on.  I tried, really tried to like it but have not touched it since.Try  to find someone who has it or a demo to see and play before you pay the  price.

Roller coaster tycoon never came out for mac, so that's why I ended up buying Sim Theme Park.  It was different than Roller Coaster tycoon in some good and bad ways, so I'll tell you them and you could decide if you want this.Pros:You can click on the ride button and ride any of the rides.  Even the custom made ones like roller coasters.You can walk around the park just like you would at a real theme park.Cons:Not enough freedom.  Once you build all of the rides, in all four parks, that's it.Everything would disappear when I won a key to open up a 4th park and I would need to reinstall the software.  A major con.  I never opened up in Space land.So that was the pros and cons.  You could decide what you think about it before you buy.

I found this game to be incredibly dull and boring, that is after it actually worked. Back when I got this game ( about 6 months ago ) I had a 500mhz computer with a Voodoo graphics accelerator but this game doesnt work. I tried it on 2 computers and it hardly worked, i have no idea why this is but it would crash and shut down and take FOREVER to load. After waiting 15-20 minutes for it to load, I finally started playing it, expecting it to be excellant...it wasn't. The graphics are ok, but they look like a cartoon! You think would be cool to ride the rides but it isnt, it looks stupid. You can hardly make any choices, maxis made them all for you. You can't just choose a place and start building you have to follow along with the little story. My advice: If you really want a good Maxis game, get the Sims! It is addictive ( but gets old after a few months ) but thats another story.

SIM THEME PARK is both complex and simple at once, which can get confusing.  It seems to be aimed at the grade school set, yet includes controls which end up being complex.  The 3D graphics are eye-poppingly fancy, and the rides and attractions are clever, but the theme parks don't seem real like they do in Roller Coaster Tycoon.  Nevertheless, this game is a fun addition to your sim library.This game is equipped with a tutorial mode, which introduces us to an annoying little character who talks all the time, attempting to explain how each control works.  After I turned the tutorial-guy off, I found it much more pleasant to play this game in which you design a theme park complete with rides, sideshows, restaurants, a staff, and other attractions.This game features parks with Disneyland-worthy themes such as Halloween (coffin restrooms!) and Prehistory (think a kinder, gentler Jurassic Park), which have clever rides and attractions.One really cool feature is the &quot;ride it&quot; option which allows you to see your ride from the perspective of someone who is on the ride.  You can also see things from the perspective of security cameras.  This is fun, but the novelty wears off.I enjoyed checking out the various types of theme parks in this game, which you get to play by earning golden keys (for reaching certain goals) but I ended up going back to Roller Coaster Tycoon, which I think is a superior game.  I give this game 3 stars for anyone over 12, but possibly more stars for anyone younger.

Seems cool, graphics were very nice. Although I experienced MASSIVE load time. Consequently, I lost interest. Control is pretty much the same as Israeli Air Force, but everything is MUCH better looking. Again, I can't say much, as my low-budget, no-name, brand-goes-out-of-business-as-soon-as-I-buy-it computer is too s--l--o--w when it comes to this one. Although, I must say the Vietnam missions in the F-105 Thunderchief were a gas, and blasting the poop out of Iraqi armor in A-10 Warthogs gave me a giggle or two.

What i love most about this game is that you can choose from so many different planes. Everything from 70's era planes from Vietnam, to the latest stealth fighters. This game has it all. The campaigns are very  challenging, yet not impossible. It has a unique way to compare your score  to other player all over the world, so you always want to try and improve.  Thankfully all previous problems with the game were fixed with the latest  patch, and Janes has also introduced a new addon that lets you try and be a  U.S. Thunderbird and perform crazy stunts at an air show. Like i said, this  game has it all. Definetly worth purchasing.

I actually ordered this game as a secondary choice. Boy was I wrong, this is definitely first rate.  I was extremely impressed with the level of detail in this simulation.  The smooth scrolling of the terrain make low level flight a definite experience.  The only drawback is that the AI is  severly lacking in creativity.  The freindly aircraft will come to your  assistance but are dependent on your commands to make any intelligent  decission when it come to target engagement.  The enemy aircraft follow  standard offensive and defensive tactics which is okay for the gamer and  simulator buff, but those craving realism require an AI that will adjust to  your moves and counter accordingly.  The shortcomings just noted are  minimal in comparison to the visual effects, audio and overall gameplay.  Nothing can be done to reduce the 5 star rating because this sim deserves  more than that.  So far running on a PIII 450 with 192 megs of RAM, 60gig  ATA66 and a Voodoo3 3000 AGP, there have been no lockups and everything has  been smooth sailing, the video after a full install that requires 1100MB of  space is still a little choppy running from a 50x CD-ROM.  Having only been  in one actual air-to-air engagement(Helicopter), I can't really ding this  game on realism.  The spectacular explosions are quite exagerated. All  minute problems aside this is deffinitely the sim to purchase, and if you  somehow thought you had a personal life... you do in front of your computer  with flightstick in hand.

USAF is hands down the best looking flight sim ever created. The beauty of the scenery leaves you breathless as you soar through the plush clouds above Vietnam, Las Vegas, or Iraq. I've been a simmer since the release of  gunship and stealth fighter on the commodore 64 (long time ago). Up to this  point, nothing has even come close. The missions are somewhat boxed, but  that isn't enough to take away the realism of the game. If your are a  stickler for graphics as I am, This is the best game by far. It's  definately a must buy for all simmers.

This is hands down the best combat simulator I have ever played. First of all, The graphics are the best you can get with the most amazing terrain I've ever seen. the gameplay is excellent and easy and you can record your  missions and watch them again at any angle. The game is easy to learn to  play  and has a great instruction booklet. You can fly up to 8 jets and all  of them look and feel different. It also records down every missle you  shot, your accuracy, how many guys you shot down and hundreds of more  stats. The multiplayer is excellent too. You can play over the internet too.  I highly recommend this game for all you flight sim lovers.

I bought this game at a store here in Russia and it was $70 translated to American.  I would have payed this price for it too.  In this game you can fly(in order from olderst to most modern), the F-4, F-105, A-10, F-15C/E,  F-15E, F-16, F-117, and the F-22.  You can even fly the Soviet MIG in the  multiplayer.  The game is so detailed they had to give you 2 CD's in an  excellent Jewl Case.  I would recomend the Mircosoft Sidewinder precision  pro, Joystick.  You have full weapon loadouts from NAPALM to AGM-130 GPS  Guided missiles to AIM-120 AMRAAM's (Advanced Medium Range Air to Air  Missiles).  You can even load the plane with External Tanks that you can  jettison if you need to intercept a possible Threat.  After with you can  call a vector to the tanker so you can top the tanks in Mid-Air.  This is  the last Military Flight Sim that you would need to buy.My only reqest  is that Janes would make a flight sim on &quot;Soviet&quot; and  &quot;Mother Russia's&quot; Air achievments (i.e. SU-27, Mig's, Su-33,  etc...)

I was very disappointed after flying it. I was excited about all the different aircraft I could fly, but I've been spoiled by Falcon4, the king of flight sims. The first problem is the constant bobbing up and down of the planes' noses after take-off and while landing. The biggest problem, IMHO, is the fact that the flight models are BAD. All the planes fly exactly alike. The A-10 is just as fast and as maneuverable as the F-15. That is not accurate. If you like accurate flight models then run, don't walk, away from USAF! The cockpits are fuzzy and the switches don't work, like they do in F4. The scenery is nice, it runs smoothly, and has never crashed on me. The missions are fair, but it doesn't have a dynamic campaign. It's heavy on eye candy, but light on flight modeling. If you just want to fly different cockpits and watch the scenery, then by all means get it. If you want accurate flight models for each plane and a dynamic campaign, then get Falcon4.

Can I ask 1 Question.. Why did EA mess up this series? I havn't played the whole series, I have 98, 99 and 2000 but gosh man, they really messed this one up.  1. Graphics - The graphics look very good.  The player faces  could have been better, but they are adequate. I like the crowd jumping up  and clapping. From a distance, it does look realistic.2. Sound - I wish  i received the European version. I have the commentry off, all i have to is  it really sucks! The crowd cheering is really cool, though it would have  been nice to have crowd biasness in home games.3. Gameplay - Purely  disgusting. Where have most of the skill moves gone! Although the ball  physics are much more realistic, it is much to easy for the computer to  pick off your passess. And I hate the free kick arrow, its is horrible. It  uses a power bar which really fails. Also, when taking corners from the  opposite side of the field, you can't see the power bar so you have no idea  how hard you kick.One of my BIGGEST problems is the refree strictness. I  put the refree strictness bar on full and the computer gets away with slide  tackles from behind all the time, even when i am running with no one  infront of me. This one really gets me mad!In conclusion, I have given  up on this game. I jump back to Fifa 99, its much much much better than  this piece of junk.

I would rate this higher than FIFA '99, but much lower than the WC98 games.  I like it better than 99 b/c I can compete at the World Class level, but doing so reveals the game's major flaws.  This game is meant to  be an action/arcade game, and is not a serious attempt at sports  simulation.  The only useful strategy I can give a player is to score  goals. If you stop attacking at all, you will regret it (for ex. I lost a  3-1 lead w/ 10 minutes to go using standard defensive strategies).  The  only good defense in this game is a good offense.  The amount of goals  scored and the distribution of goals are ludicrous. 13 games into the  Premier season, I as Leeds United have scored 47 goals, 35 of those by the  2 forwards (Huckerby, Bridges).  The gameplay awards knowledge of knowing  when to press the right button, not knowledge of football (soccer).As  far as the announcers go, they do sound totally wrong announcing European  games (they're fine if you stick to MLS).  As bad as they are, I don't find  them as annoying as John Motson's sidekick from FIFA 99 (that guy sounded  like a parrot).  There are also key players missing from some teams  (especially in the MLS).There aren't any real stadiums in the game either.  (Those with RIVA 128/TNT graphics cards will have to download new Detonator  drivers to make the game work)The positives about the game are the great  graphics (although the players are skinny, and the screen jumps sometimes  when the computer has to read the CD).  It has classic teams, such as Man.  United '68 and Brazil '70, that make for some fun matchups. And as  unrealistic as it is, it's fun to play.

This is probably *the* football game you want to buy if you're into the  MLS.  If not, stick with an earlier version and hope that FIFA 2001 returns  to form with a more global view.I read the reviews prior to buying and  wasn't deterred by the lukewarm reception of Phil Schoen and Julie Foudy as  the commentators.  I figured, &quot;what the heck? I'm more interested in  the gameplay improvements anyway&quot; (last EA FIFA title for me was Road  to the World Cup 98 which I think is the superior of the two).  Let me tell  you, though, Foudy and Schoen *are* annoying and they do detract from the  experience in a big way.  I could only handle two full matches with the  commentary on.  EA Sports should be sent off the pitch for replacing John  Motson.  It does matter.  The packaging, messaging and overall tone of the  game is heavily biased toward MLS.  You don't need to know much about  football to know that MLS doesn't hold a candle to the European leagues.As for the gameplay -- well there are some improvements.  The options,  controls and features haven't changed much if at all.  There's a few new  moves compared to RTTWC 98 which are fun -- options to shield the ball,  some new moves (360 degree turns, flip kicks, step overs, etc.) and better  free kick targeting.  The gameplay moves much faster and it takes some  getting used to.  I was used to world class in RTTWC 98 and was thoroughly  trounced in professional level in FIFA 2000.  That's a good thing though.  Didn't want it to be too easy.  The passing indicator is dubious at best.  It's green if the lane is open, yellow if a defender is near and red if  it's blocked.  No matter the color, though, most of my passes were easily  intercepted.  Camera angles and graphics are vastly improved as well.  The  players are also more emotive than before.  The music, of course, is still  cool.In all, though, I wouldn't recommend this version if you're  looking to upgrade an older FIFA release.  The addition of the MLS isn't a  bonus in my book and the commentary severely detracts from the experience.  Hopefully, EA Sports will get back to form with FIFA 2001 or RTTWC 2002.  If you can't wait until then you can't say you weren't warned ...

I knew I was in trouble when I saw Eddie Pope on the cover of the box instead of a proper footballer like Beckham, Yorke, or Rivaldo.  Who buys FIFA 2000 to play mediocre MLS teams, or hear American announcers who sound  as though they've just gotten out of bed. Where is their enthuisiasm and  their spirit. What about the idea that the announcers broadcasting the game  should know the names of the players? They act as though every match they  were broadcasting were as boring as the typical Wimbledon vs. Derby County  fixture. I liked the game better when EA didn't try to Americanize it.  Basically all of the negative reviews that have been posted so far are on  target.

Just a shame that many things do not work anymore as they did on previous versions. It seems they tried to improve details instead of major things like more leagues that matter. Where is the Argentinian league? When are they going to realize that it is one of the best leagues in the world? I'm  sad to say that I have lost faith in EA Sports and how they put out games.  It's a shame that they seem to go backwards.

This is the best soccer game at the moment.  The amount of teams is brilliant especially the older teams.  I guess its cool that it has an MLS license but the people that moan about it not being a good use of the  license are wrong.  I mean who cares about MLS when you can play as  English, Spanish, and Italian teams to name a few.  The graphics are also  really good, I love the inside the goal replay camera, and the way the  players open their mouths to celebrate after a goal is unique.  Overall,  you should get this game if you like soccer even a little bit because it is  the best.

This game is a great game. I also have FIFA 1998. FIFA 2000 is better than FIFA '98 and any other soccer game because you can be an MLS team as well as an international team and the players on the other team are not totally  stupid. You can actually get the ball stolen from you and the score is not  extremely high. The players also jump over the slide tackle so you don't  get the ball every time you slide. The animation is good and the moves of  the players are similar to what they do in real life. The goalies do not  always catch the ball. Sometimes they punch the ball over the crossbar, but  not more than they would in real life.

Fifa series are going down (I mean the level) very fast this time! I had Fifa99 it was a good game for me, but I thought I need a new DATA for the new players to know &quot;where&quot; there are.Unfortunately I had a shock  because there was not so many new options that I thought. I have an advice  to the EA-Sports:  &quot;The people are not mad because the game is bad.  They are mad because there ARE NOT SO MANY NEW OPTIONS as there was at the  independence between the Fifa 98 and the 99!&quot;

Who does EA Sports think it is fooling? This game is worthy of an add-on to Fifa 99 at best.I found myself getting extremely bored of this game.There is, as of yet, no internet support, poor AI, un-real simulation,  and mediocre team management. I advise all to wait till the next one comes  out- I'm sure after their poor sales EA will finally take the hint and  actually produce a NEW game- not some tired version of Fifa 99.

In my opinion FIFA 2000 is much better than the old ones.If you like football PC simulators you must try it. Now it's easier to play like if you were watching a football match at home.You can also play with friends by  net, is a wonderful experience. On the other hand, the problem is that EA  tries to americanize the essencia of the football game. I don't understand  why now we can't select the stadium in which we prefer play.Furthermore,  the importance given to the american league in the game isn't linked with  reality: Why are better considered the american and british teams than the  spanish or italian ones ?.

Like NHL 2001, this was one of the first games I bought for my new computer.  Once you get a hang of the controls, its wicked easy to play.  I know some people complain about the through-passing control; personally, it doesn't work all the time, but most of the time you can execute it nicely.  The options for gameplay are excellent, although one wonders why MLS is not included in league mode?  If you don't know the cheats for this game, get them online somewhere, they're a riot even if you don't use them all the time...EA Sports has definitely improved on this with 2001, and sounds like it made 2002 even more like real soccer.  but it doesn't have to be completely real to be enjoyable!  When FIFA 2002 comes out I will probably buy it.  But at the same time, I'll always have 2000 on my shelf.  Thanks alot EA Sports!

Another season, another dose of EA Sports games. Somehow I think the latest batch do not bring enough change to warrant buying them. NBA and NHL brought small improvements but FIFA 2000 for me is what 99 should have been  (similar to the Win98 over Win95? ). Improved graphics but no licencsed  stadia or faces, similar gameplay, new lineups (expansion pack? ).Being  an avaid FIFA player from 98 the only new features which did it for me were  the new replays and set pieces. What displeased me was the still near  impossability to score from outside the box (real life simulation?) no free  kicks bulging the nets and still the oppositions inability to score many  goals - even on World Class level. And do we REALLY need Robbie Williams  advertising on the box?So does it warrant a cool 30 squids with all the  great new titles coming out? I think you should wait til Fifa 2001 where it  will be exactly the same game but with better crowd movements and sounds -  TRUST ME this is what is going to happen

Once again EA Sports out did it-self with FIFA 2000.  The moves of the  players to the crowd cheering in the back got me quite excited while  playing the game.  The team rosters and the updates that they placed on the  uniforms show how they know the game. I would recommend it to all soccer  (football) advocates.
