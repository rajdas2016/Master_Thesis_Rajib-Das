Until recently, i have been wearing and defending Chuck's for the past 25 years. BUT! The past three pair that i bought all blew out on me in less than a month! They either ripped at the heal. Popped open on the outside around the toes for when you are doing ollies. Cracked in the insole. Or all of the above! i hate writing this because i absolutely love what Chuck's USED to be! Converse used to be the great all American all purpose shoe that could be worn in any occasion. HELL! i wore mine to my high school prom!  But that is no longer the case. Instead, Converse's quality has steadily decreased over the years, while their prices have steadily increased over the years. How in the hell does that even make sense?! Now as for me and my family, we will no longer buy Chuck's until they raise their quality standards bcak to what they used to be. Because if they are just going to make crap shoes then why be loyal to the Chuck Taylor brand? Just buy some generic sneakers and paint them up yourselves. And maybe, just maybe Converse will start to listen and once again make that great all American, made in America shoe that we all once loved.

I'm not sure about these being stylish or comfortable, but they are classics.I bought a pair 5 years ago, but they are uncomfortable for long walks, and don't even try to run in them, you will hurt yourself if you aren't used to these. You can run in these, but you'll need to develop calf strength and learn to walk and run mid-foot or front foot. Heel strike walking in these will lead to lower back and knee pain.These shoes are cheap and excellent shoes for weightlifting, because they are mostly uncompressed-able and give a very strong and stable base. Excellent for planting squats. These are also good for boxing/heavy bag work, because they give you a stable plant while not sticking to the ground: these shoes let me pivot very well for full force strikes to a heavy bag with putting any pressure on my knees.These are great shoes for people who lift and box. Looking at the sole, you can really tell that these were obviously designed by an athlete who needed a shoe with a stable base that was also great for pivoting, and made sense that these were once basketball shoes.For long walks, I would suggest getting the Crocs version of these called the "Hovers." Much better for long and comfortable walking.

As usual, Converse has created a great pair of shoes. Stylish, functional, and for the most part, fairly waterproof.I've actually found that Hi Top Taylors are better built than regular Converse. They seem to last longer than the ones with low tops.I have to warn you, if you've never worn this kind of shoe before, get ready for a need to break the shoes in. At first, they killed my feet. Not to mention the Hi Top part kept rubbing against my heels. But now, I can wear them without socks and they don't hurt at all (unless you run, hike, jog, slam your feet down, etc).That said, the sole provides minimal cushioning to your feet, so be careful what you do in them. Definitely don't run on hard surfaces with these.At the gym, I always take these off, and just go in my socks. Feels a lot better.Get ready to look awesome, feel awesome, and to dance a lot (they're good for that)

I have always liked Converse All Stars and when I saw the charcoal color I had to have them. The size is good for me.  I had a blue pair (low tops) last year and they were snug on my right foot because of a previous injury.  Those were a size 8 so I got these in size 9 and now no more pain :) .  They run narrow in my opinion so if your foot is a bit wide I'd size up.

Good, heavyweight denim, but the cut of the jeans is way too full, especially in the leg and even after washing. Was the design influenced by gang attire, like the super-full, deep crotch, short pants, teenagers waddle around in? If that's your style, then give the jeans a few more stars.But these pants are not for adult men, and I don't expect much use of them. Some warning as to the cut needs to be in the on-line pants descriptions.

I have 4 pairs of these shoes and I love them to death!  They are as close to indestructable as any shoe I've ever owned.  Then you're probably asking why I have so many.  Well, the answer is that this is the only shoe I know of that comes in so many colors (I've seen at least 7 or 8 colors) and works with just about everything in your wardrobe!  Jeans, khakis, whatever- they work, and I love 'em!!!

These were my first pair of really nice shoes and will probably be the only tennis shoes I will ever buy. They are very versatile; I can wear them when I am out on a walk, on a run, to school, to church and they are great when I am traveling. They even fit bulky orthotics and my wide feet that other tennis shoes are not made to handle. Adidas are comfortable, stylish and the ultimate tennis shoe!

The first time I saw a pair of Superstars was 8 years ago and I thought they were the coolest looking all-purpose shoes I had ever seen. I immediately went out and bought my first pair and haven't been without at least 2 styles ever since. Classic, simple, comfortable, and durable, they have never failed me whether at work (I'm a Fed Ex courier) or play. The break in period is almost non-existent and best of all, the sole wears out before the upper leather portion wears out. For the price and dependability, you cannot lose with this shoe!

Having recently purchased the Bailey of Hollywood Traveler in brown & liking that a lot, I thought I'd risk the Jos A Bank version in black because of the 50% lower price. I should not have. As received, the hat was partially crushed & since the felt did not come back into shape, I am guessing that it had been crushed awkwardly as it was in their warehouse before it made it into the box. No, it's not a big deal ... so the crown will need to get the proper "dent" and "pinch" put back into it, eh. I can do that. But I also notice that the felt seems softer and thinner on this Chinese-made hat than on a US-made Bailey (which has complicated the whole fedora shape-fixing process). My advice... go with a Bailey and pay the money for it, it is worth it! Traveler

After reading some reviews was concerned about proper sizing.  Found sizing chart @ underarmour.com.  I'm 6'6 and 220lbs, broad shouldered, lean and decently well muscled(working to gain).  Usually I wear an  XL in a futile atempt to gain length and get stuck with (alot) of excess width but larges are usually shortish and a little tight through the shoulder upper back.  The chart recommended a Large and keeping in mind this is a compression and wicking shirt it fits nice and tight.  The shirt is not dificult to get on or off which other products I have tried can be dificult in one or both.  I have not done any training in the shirt so cannot at this time comment on the active functionality such as wicking, energy level/recovery from compression or chafing.  I am very pleased with the shirt and also feel confident in the size both currently and that it will do as the body makes adjustment with continued training.  I also would consider changing whole T-shirt wardrobe to these as they fit so much more comfortably then most normal T's.  Also got the same shirt for my wife and utilizing the size chart it is also an early success.

The shirt is fine, good quality, fresh, comfortable, like the picture. It is a little delicate if you touch with it surfaces irregular... some strip can fall out. I bought two sizes more thinking about my son could wear it for more time and it will not fit too tight like picture... maybe that is uncomfortable for a kid BUT although that size fit relax but fine the sleeve is too long, I had to cut it so I think that the better way is to buy it in the correct size or maybe one size more and cut the sleeve. Wherever, my son loves to wear this tee.(Sorry for my english)

This is probably the best compression t-shirt in the market...

I wear size s ... I think the new design it's better than the one in terms of fitting...

But the process was easy and he was very pleased with the shirt in the smaller size. It's great for wearing under t-shirts or under jerseys for football and baseball practices.

I must say that this compression gear is the best gym attire I have ever experienced.  I have a slim build and am quite muscular.  This gear shows off your muscles in all the right places.  During my workout, I received quite a few compliments on it.  Of course the looks of appreciation never hurt either. I will be purchasing more in various colors.

My 9 year old nephew told me he wanted "Under Armour" for Christmas. I had no idea what he was talking about. I asked - "Under arm deoderant"? "Undershirt"? I was ever the un-cool aunt for not knowing what he wanted. I found out that 3 of my friends experienced the same thing. ;)  The shirt runs very tight, and even though my nephew is smaller for his age, the large just barely fit him. He asked for a second one for his birthday (and so did my sister, so she could get the shirt off of him and wash it). The kid loves it, and if he gives it 5 stars, so do I.

I returned the first shirt because it was too small. When I received the first shirt I looked at the sizing guide and should have ordered the large.  The guide stated that size large fits a 14-16.  It is a bit snug for the size, but it works.  We were happy to have it this weekend for a softball tournament. There should be a sizing guide on Amazon for these items.  I'm happy with the product.

I bought two of these for both my boy's; one plays football, the other runs track for their schools.

I have been wearing compression shirts for years.  Under Armour is by far the best quality.  It is called compression wear for a reason.  It is supposed to conform to every bulge and crevice of your body.  I am 5' 8", 155 lbs. and a size medium fits just like it is supposed to.  If you have more bulges than crevices you are going to have trouble fitting into the size of shirt you normally wear.  Compression shirts and leggings were designed to support muscles and keep them at a comfortable temperature.  They also have a wonderful ability to wick away moisture.  However, I think one of the best features is that since they don't slide around they prevent the cloth from chafing tender body areas like nipples and armpits during long runs and rides.  Compression wear was not created to look sexy.  It is serious workout gear.  If you have a pot belly or love handles going up one or even two sizes is not going to help.  Even though they will tightly stretch around overfed body parts those bulges will still vividly show - the shirts aren't girdles.  They make these things in loose fit also.  Not quite the same benefits, but a significant improvement over a cotton t-shirt.  If you can wear the compression shirts get them, but expect them to be skin tight.  You won't regret it.

I purchased an Under Armour compression tee at a local store in a size Large. The shirt fit fantastic. I wanted a back up so I purchased this one online size Large, different color. The shirt arrives on time, open the package and it is a Large but does not even fit over my shoulders.... I contacted the vendor for an exchange. They do not do exchanges but will allow me to return the shirt. If the shirt was worn it has to be washed before returning it... no problem for I could not get the shirt on anyway so tags etc were all in place. If you pass 30 days, there is a restocking fee of 20% which I was unaware of.When I questioned the vendor why I have a Large and ordered the same size it did not fit. The vendor stated that Under Armour has different sizing charts for different shirts.  That just did not make sense. How are you to buy a product with "floating" sizes.So, I went online to Nordstrum to find the same exact heat guard compression tee. There was a size chart that could be pulled up to check size before ordering.... only 1 chart for Under Armour. I did all the measurements correctly to find that I was to order a Large.I know the shirt fits tight but since I already HAD a large that fits, and the chart from Under Armor at Nordstrum confirmed that I had ordered the correct shirt size, the statement that there are different size charts for different Under Armour shirts " just doesn't fit!".I personally will visit a store and actually try it on to avoid the hassle and disappointment of waiting for a product that does not fit, seemingly was ordered correctly, and then had to be mailed back.

I purchased one of these shirts from Sport Check and paid $30 for it. It was comfortable and I had no problems with it until 1 day I noticed some white flakes on the front of it. When I tried to wipe them off I saw that it was the material that was flaking off in a perfect circle. The more I brushed the bigger the hole grew. Now you can see through the center of my shirt like some nylon stockings, which looks pretty girly. For a $30 shirt I sure expected to get a lot more wear out of it.
