I purchased this gate and after a month the gate would not remain attached/connected. I would connect it in a circle so my 1 year old could play safely inside. However, after a short time, my 1 year old began lean against the panels or pull herself up on the side and the gate would unconnect. She would either fall or push it open and crawl out. I tried to return to VM Innovations because it was defective and a safety hazard but they don't stand behind the products they sell. They told me to contact the manufacturer. VM Innovations sold me the product and collected my money so they should work with the manufacturer like most retailers do. Even Walmart returns defective products especially with safety concerns. I filed an A-to- Z claim with Amazon. I'm hoping Amazon steps up when VM Innovations has not. There is too many good companies that stand behind the products they sell and have good customer to buy from vendors like VM Innovations.

We bought this and the extension pack for our now 3 year old when he was starting to crawl.  Now his baby brother uses it and it is my lifesaver.  Thought it might be a little too pricey when we first go it, but have found it to be well worth the cost and then some!  Not only does it keep our 10 month old out of trouble, but when he's in it I know his brother can't bug him either.  We foundly refer to ours as the &quot;cage&quot;.I highly recommend it to anyone with a baby soon to be toddler!

We got this for our ten month old in December. She hated it at first. Would cry and scream when  we would put her in it and walk a few feet away. Now... she loves it! She crawls around inside it and plays with all her toys by herself. We have it set up in the living room so that we can keep an eye on her while eating, cooking or watching TV. It is set up so that she has a good view of everything around her... she can even look out the window and play in the sun coming in though the window. When we have her DVD's on or Noggin' she can see the screen very easily.As far as the climbing goes... She was already pulling herself up before we got this. The holes in the sides help her master pulling up. She now pulls herself up and stands unassisted.It can be taken outside in the yard, to the park or to the beach. Take a pack-n-play to the beach and have soooo much fun getting all the sand out! Also, all those toys with the Link-a-Doos? They attach to the sides! And there's plenty of room inside the fencing for something like Fisher Price's Dance Baby Dance with plenty of room left for playing, crawling etc. In fact we can get in there with her and it is not crowded!We suggest anyone that doesn't have all day and every single second to spend watching their child(ren) get this. It is a good buy.

I recieved this as a shower gift and began using it when my daughter began to crawl.  It was better than any play yard because there is much more room for toys and for baby.  As she grew (and the number of toys as well), I purchased an extension to make the area bigger.  It was great for both indoor and outdoor use.  We also used it to block the large open area between our kitchen and family room that no other gate would be large enough to cover.  Now that winter is here and she is running about, we are using it to block our wood(pellet) stove to prevent any accidents.  We also plan on using it around our Christmas tree again this year. Other reviews have complained that it is not sturdy or difficult to set up.  I have never had a problem and it folds up and stores easily.  Well worth it for it's versatility.

I began using this when my first daughter began to crawl.  I liked that it was bigger than any playpen or playyard and could accommodate my growing daughter as well as her toys.  It is easy to put together and I purchased an additional section to make it even larger.  We have used it at home, at the beach, in the yard and as a barrier for both the Christmas tree and pellet (wood) stove to keep our little ones safe.

I like this yard, because it is sturdy enough to keep my one year old inside and safe. It is also large enough, with the extension, that she does not feel confined--which means she won't cry when she's inside! That's a good thing! The only thing that is kind of a pain at first, is opening the panels, but once you get the hang of it, it's really easy! Anyway, I would definitely recommend this for a mobile baby--with the extension, or in my case, another yard in addition to the first.

I can't say enough great things about this item!!  We love it so much we have 2 and will be getting a 3rd!!  So versatile with oodles of uses.  We used one last christmas to keep our 10 month old from pulling it over or eating ornaments!  We then bought another set and put the two together for a super large play area in the basement (we used step 2, 3/4 inch 2x2 foam interlocking mats underneath it for safety) And now mom and dad can use the exercise room and our now 21 month old can play safely.  We are planning to buy a third set to put around the fireplace (with some manipulation)and hauling the sets from the basements upstairs to go around this years christmas tree.  We have had these for quite sometime and i have not found any real negatives to speak of.  It is a great product at a great price with a tremendous resale value on ebay.

When my twin boys were 6 months old, they outgrew the baby bouncers and wanted down. The conventional &quot;playpens&quot; were dangerous...they could roll under the net &amp; get stuck between the net &amp; particle board floor. The &quot;play yards&quot; were too small for two. Then I thought of the superyard... my sister had triplets and had used one for them with great success. My twins loved it! They had plenty of room to play and learned to crawl &amp; walk in it by holding on to the sides. I credit their walking so early (9 mos.) to their ability to move around alot in the play yard. It kept them very contained, yet they could see out and be part of the family, too. Unfortunately, by the time they were 12 months old, they had learned to climb out or push hard and tip it over. I now use it to divide my family room in half by running it straight across the room like a fence. We tuck it between the couch and the table behind it, and run it against the side wall. We couldn't find a &quot;gate&quot; to cross such a large room, but now the superyard does the trick! I only wish they would make one taller for my toddlers (with a &quot;walk through&quot; gate for us parents.) This is a wonderful alternative to the tiny play yards being made today.

I have a 9 month old and this superyard is great for keeping him contained.  He stays in it for quite a while because it is big enough for him to crawl in and cruise around by hanging on the sides.  He can have a bunch of toys in there to play with while I am busy doing something else.  I have it on an area rug because we have hardwood floors and it needs to be able to grip on a rough surface.It's big so he feels like he's in the room rather than being stuck in a play yard.  I can even get in there with him and play.  It was also great for him learning to pull up and stand.  The walls make wonderful handholds and it doesn't hurt him too much if he falls against them.I was a little worried after reading a few negative reviews.  I agree with others - make sure you have enough room for it.  Some kids will be able to hurt themselves on anything no matter how safe you think it is.  Also, you must NOT use it as a straight line barrier - simple mechanics tells you that it won't have any stability that way.I would highly recommend this to anyone - I'm going to try taking it with me to grandma's this week.  Hopefully it travels easily - grandma's house is an open plan split-level and now that my son is mobile, something like this will be invaluable!Update:  7 years later and 3 more babies later...  We used this for all the children and it still held up strong.  We replaced two of the panels because the plastic cracked (due to age) which was easy to do because they sell two-panel sets so you can extend the yard to a bigger octagonal one if you want.  Another great use for this play yard is when the kids are toddlers and you want to protect your Christmas tree.  We have consistently put the play yard around our Christmas tree so that the little ones won't get in at the presents, ornaments, or generally pull on the branches and tip the tree over.

it will NOT make a regular octagon, even if you have 8 panelsthe problem is, it  only opens to certain angles, and 135 degrees is not one of themit only does 90, 120, and 150(but 120 degrees is good for a hexagon, just don;t think if you have to have any old number of panels, you can make any polygon you want, you can;t.. additionally the SQUARE, which you can make with the 90 degree angles, are not very strong and not recommended by the instructions, especially if you are thinking, i can have use 8 panels to make a square, it will be very flimsy in the middle of the straight junction.. they specifically say DO NOT do that, have 2 sides joined at a 0 degree angle.. basically a hexagon is about all it really works for.. though a 4 sided square works, it isn;t weak, it is just tiny..)so you can HAVE an 8-sided fencebut the angles will have to be half 120 and half 150 degreeswhich is more of a square, just with bent sidesnot a real regular stop-sign type octagon!@#$plus it;s a little flimsyand (no matter what the shape is) there is no way to have an easy open/close gate, you have to either step over it or take a side apart every time [very hard]when i bought it, the store guy said ''oh what kind of dogs do you have..?''hmALSOwhen your kids get to about 18 months or so, they can either move the sides, by walking while pushing on a side, which changes the angle  you had it set to, or just lifting it and crawling undergood for babiestoddlers, not so mucheither fix it to the floor somehow, or accept that they will escapedogs might do that tooespecially just dig under or root it up with their nose and go underwle

The Superyard gives our 9 month old plenty of space to play, compared to pack-n-plays.  He is strong for his age, pushing and pulling at the sides, and can pull himself up holding onto the side, but it has remained stable.  As to ease of use, it took me less than a minute to set up and start using - much easier to assemble and move around than traditional playards.  I can move it from our living room to basement to back patio quickly.  We also used it as a barrier around the TV when several toddlers were recently at our house.  As long as you follow directions and use common sense, this is a great product.

Be very careful when setting up and breaking down this product because pieces of it can snap off. Little pieces of plastic broke off of my Superyard. I am glad my 8-month-old child didn't get to them before I did because the three small pieces that broke off were sharp choking hazards.

We bought this to help contain our 8 month old son! He hates to be confined in a play yard and loves to crawl and explore EVERYTHING!! It is big enough to fit his toys inside, but doesn't take up much room in our living room. He has been pulling up on since we put him in there, and the sturdy gates never move. This has been a great helper when trying to cook dinner, do household chores or simply use the restroom! This is a great buy!

I highly recommend this superyard and all of it's add on pieces along with it! As a mother of 5 children ages 8, 7, 4, 1, and 3 weeks, I have raised my children with my superyard! Not only has this yard held up for 8 years, it has seen the many different states along the way and provided a safe playspace during camping trips, picnics, a trip to a beach, in the front yard and the list goes on. Better yet, I hook mine to a friends and we have a huge playspace for a few little ones. This playyard has constantly given me piece of mind knowing my little ones are not just roaming the house either crawling or walking and keeps safe toys inside and the older kids small pieced toys outside! A must for every parent or grandparent! And now they even have a sunshade for them! Just doesn't get any better!

I can't say enough good things about this product.  I have a very open floor plan so it was impossible to block areas off for my toddler.  I always felt guilty when I had to clean or do anything that would take me away because he would cry from being confined to the play yard, but now he has space to roam in and I can go about my daily routine knowing that he is in a safe environment and is happy to have all that space.  I don't feel as though I am confining my child anymore, just keeping him safe. He has a large area to play in and I am able to get other things done and give my older child some undivided attention.  I have thought about buying another superyard XT and doubling his play area, but I will give this extention kit a shot first.  I can't wait until summer to take him out I have an umbrella and stand that I think will work great to keep him shaded but allow him time outdoors.  If there is a babys r us in your area buy it there it will save you quite a bit on shipping.

I bought this for my grand-daughter shortly after she moved into our home and got a couple of bruises on her head from falling against our cabinets etc. This has worked perfectly as it moves enough when she does slip to prevent injury . Furthermore I also bought the extra panels and it makes a very large area for her to exercize and practice all of her new found skills. I love it.

This Superyard is great! It gives about 2 times as much space as a normal playpen. And the extenders make it even better than that. You have to be careful when putting it together so you don't pinch your fingers...but I just make my husband do it, so my fingers are fine :) My son just loves to play in in and we hung a bunch of toys from the side to encourage him to stand and move around. Excellent purchase!

This system is great, especially if you have a baby like my son, who would not stay in a playpen without screaming. Also, if you buy the extension, its big enough for them to crawl in, not as confining to them, and no worries for you because you can walk away knowing they are safe. My son is now 2, so doesn't use it, but I have lent it to a friend who's baby is the same as my son was, and she raves about it too. I am due any day now, and this product will be used again with him once he's mobile. It is made well and is just as sturdy as it was back when.  I highly recommend it, WITH the extension.Oh, and a BIG plus that should be mentioned separately, if you have a playful or hyper dog, you at least have piece of mind that the baby is safe inside since it is so sturdy (unless you have a jumping dog like me!).

I love the extention kits. We bought the yard and loved it but found that it was too small for both of the children to play in together comfortably. The extention kits allow you to make the yard big enough for several children to play in.

I bought this playard when my oldest daughter was born (8 years ago).  She loved it!!  I was able to get in the playard with her and play and she loved that.  She never cried or felt closed in because the design is so open.  I took it to the beach and put it right on the sand and she was just as happy as she could be.  I've also taken it to the pool.  There is nowhere this playard can't go!  Now that I've had my second child (3 mos.) I've started putting him in it to keep the dog off him while he's laying on the floor playing with his activity gym.  This playard in my opinion is priceless and there has never been a better baby product out there to keep your baby safe from household disasters and keep you sane from chasing them all over the house!  Good luck with this product-I know you'll love it!!!

don't bother with this extention kit, just get another Superyard XT. it comes out to almost the same price, but you'll get 6 panels, instead of 2.this is well made and simple to use, just not enough panels for the price.

I have never written a review before, but I felt compelled to do so now.  I have the superyard. It is awesome, I am here to buy the extension kit now.  My son is fast, into everything, and he would definately have been injured now without this thing.  It is great.  It keeps him safe, keeps me sane, and keeps the rest of the house safe too. I have a 30 gallon aquarium I need to get a new stand for because I am terrified he would pull the thing down.  With this I dont have to worry. He ruined our stereo speakers and I dont have to worry about that anymore.  We rent a very old house that is almost impossible to childproof properly, and it is so cluttered, I hate to put him in a cage, but since I have no choice, this is perfect. He has plenty of OPEN space, I don't feel so bad now. Play pens and play yards were useless, the child cannot learn to walk in those things. This way he is on the ground, living and learning to live like the rest of us, only he is safe. I reccommend it for everyone.  No one parent should be without it. It is much better than chasing your child all day and saying no, doorway gates cannot compare to this, he is just safe from everything.  One thing though. Kmart online has it ten dollars cheaper. The actual system that is. This two piece extension is cheaper here right now, and I have a gift certificate.  I can see where this would work for pups too.  It is a bit of a pain to put together though, but well worth it, so I dont complain!

It is great that extra sections are available to extend the size the the superyard area. The superyard is quick and easy to set up and the extra sections are just as easy to attach. It is nice to have something so easy and portable to keep the children in a safe play area. Especially around the holidays while visiting friends or family.

My mother-in-law suggested we get my son a larger play pen so he can have more room to crawl and walk.  I thought this item would be too large in my home, but even though it is larger than the standard playpens, it's wonderful.  We just keep it over our area rug.  He can easily see through it, and the best part is.. the dog can't get him.  The other plus... when we go out... it can be easily moved over to our tiled floor area for the dog.  There is only one down side.  Your rug area needs to be well padded, if your child is just learning to stand, because if they fall and hit their head on the ground, it can hurt them.

After waiting an additional 3 weeks from the time I got the Superyard, I tried to fit the extension onto the Superyard as it was much needed. IT DIDN'T WORK! I guess you are supposed to get 2 of the extensions, but I still don't see how they would fit. Neither myself or my husband could figure out how to connect the extension to the superyard; nothing we tried worked.

I just had to review this great product!  We bought the superyard when my youngest son was 6 months old (he's now 2 1/2).  It worked GREAT with him but it has had much more use also!  I used it about a year ago for my two Golden Retrievers when they were puppies to keep them from destroying my house when inside and to contain them when outside since we live on 5 acres with no fence.  And now, I'm using it for our latest animal addition, a 2 month old Dutch bunny -- it's great to use inside or outside with it also.  I'm getting either the extension or another superyard to give him more room since he will be using it for a long time hopefully.  Just thought I'd let everyone know how very useful this item is!!

I had been waiting for a playpen as a gift from my aunt and uncle, which never happened.  So my husband and I went looking for one and the ones we saw were too small and there was a weight capacity.  My son will be 1 years old in Feb. and he already is almost passed the 30 pound point.  He also realized that he can really get around! So we purchased the Superyard and decided that he needed more space so we also got the Extension Kit to give him more room to move.  Now he plays when he wants and naps when he wants and I don't have to worry about him grabbing plugs out of walls and chewing on them.  I would highly recommend this product for children that need that extra space!

If it weren't for this super yard, our son would be into trouble all the time! Mommy can't watch him 24/7, so it's nice to be able to put him in the super yard and go to the bathroom in peace! And he doesn't cry in it like he does the pack n play. I love this product. We will use it on the deck this summer with some outdoor carpet beneath it, too.

I have had my gate for about two mo. My 15 mo old son is only 2&quot; taller than the gate and he can scale it with ease. I bought the gate for its height and sturdyness but never imagined he could climb it. the gate has a perfect step in the hole in the middle it makes it very easy to escape. I am returning my gate and finding one that does not have foot holes that help childrens scale the gate...

We purchased this gate to mount between a wall & wrought iron railing at the top of a staircase.  We had a difficult time trying to find a gate that could be mounted in these conditions so we were excited to find this one.My husband installed the gate after having to purchase new screws because the ones that came with the gate were really short & stripped easy in the iron railing.Our gate isn't sturdy at all.  In fact, it seems pretty flimsy....and it is installed correctly.  I wouldn't trust it to hold the weight of my (17 lb) daughter if she were to stand up and lean on it.  We will keep it up until we can find a replacement.I think it would be ok if it wasn't mounted at the top of the stairs.  Someone had mentioned in a previous review that it was easy to climb and I can see how that would be the case.  The little holes are perfect little steps.Bottom line, I would not recommend this gate for the top of a stairway.  Just in a hallway...may be ok but I'm sure you could find better.  Pretty disappointing.

I have 6 of these gates. I have 3 very wide openings in my house that lead to places my daughter should not be. It recomends not to put 2 side-by-side, but i tried this anyway. If you tighten them enough, its just like 1 really big gate. At first, i was using them in a single doorway in our old apartment, to keep my daughter from the kitchen. There, they were not very sturdy at first. But i found that if you tighten them as much as you can without breaking the cabinet walls, then its quite sturdy. Theyre pretty good, but they take some effort to work with. I also would like if i didnt have to step over them.

I thought this gate was a wonderful deal for the price and the fact you could use it on the stairs.  Boy, was I wrong!  It works horrible on the stairs.  The hinges the company sent are xxx.  The gate is constantly falling off them when you open it to go up the stairs.

A little over a year ago I had a dog who had seziures and rammed her head into things. I bought the supergate to keep her confined to one room for safety. The gate lasted about a week and the plastic parts that made it extend &amp; retract broke. IF THIS GATE COULD NOT HOLD BACK A WEAK AND SICKLY DOG THAN HOW COULD IT HOLD BACK A DETERMINDED TODDLER?  I am now pregnant and KNOW that the supergate is not good enough for my family! (children or dogs)

These is a great set for toddlers.  We have had these for almost 4 years now and they hold up great.  I don't put them in the dishwasher but I think that you can.  I love the cup - so easy for little hands to hold.  The plate is also nice.  I tend to grab it before the others that I have.  I prefer just a regular plate.  I don't like the ones that are divided.  I have given this as a gift too.  Would definitely buy again.

I bought this for my 19 month old who loves Thomas the Tank. I would have given it a 5 rating had it not been for the fact that after one day my little one dropped the bowl and cup on the kitchen floor and it shattered. Surely this being a kids set should have a little more durability. I did however buy another one since its so cute, and next time I will keep it out the hands of my toddler.
