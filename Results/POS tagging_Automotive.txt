These jack stands do what they are supposed to do. My Disco 2 is about 5,000 lbs and they hold it just fine. My only advice is that you make sure you know your vehicle height. These jack stands are tall. I use them on the lowest setting on my Disco and I still have to jack it up an inch or so to get it high enough to put these under. I will be lifting it soon though, so that will change, and hence the reason I got these. For a normal car though, these would probably not be my first choice.Also, if you are using them on asphalt, be aware that they might sink down into the ground a little. On concrete you wouldn't have this problem, but asphalt is soft enough that the edges of the stands might cut through.Finally, be safe and get a good pair of wheel chalks to use.

you can hardly find these in local auto stores and the ones the do sell cost just as much without the double locking ability and also are probably only 2 ton. I have a kid and I just don't think something holding so much weight should easily collapse with the flip of a lever.

I used these when I changed the brakes on my 1999 Civic. I intentionally got jack stands that were overrated for the job and I have full confidence that these will hold up both my Civic and my Mazda 5.It was a little tricky to bend the metal tab that holds in the part that extends and retracts, but that is a very small complaint. Overall, I am very happy with these and look forward to using them for many more repairs.

These jack stands are awesome!  I own a Chevrolet Avalanche Z71 and I can fit most standard jack stands underneath the frame without even jacking up the truck, so I needed jack stands that give me the high lift ability while still remaining stable.  The lift range on these jack stands is great, and the build quality is very high.  I have complete confidence in these jack stands while working beneath the truck.  Similar jack stands are well over $75.  The additional safety lock is a great feature, especially if you have to work near the jack stand.  It is a simple metal bar that slides in between the lift teeth, preventing the neck from lowering.

For a SAFETY item, this is probably the worst I've seen.  After seeing a similar review of these jack stands, I inspected the stands I received.  They were right.  The WELDS were AWFUL!  Spotty and not done very well.I initially purchased these since I liked the redundant safety feature of having the ratchet AND the locking pin.  HOWEVER, the piss-poor quality of the welds are not acceptable!If it were a non-critical piece, then a slightly weak weld could be forgiven especially given it's price point.It's beyond my return window to send it back to Amazon, but I couldn't see having it end up in anybody else's hands in good conscience.  I won't even give them away.  They're going straight into the dumpster.  The frame is going separate from the jack.Do not risk your life or the life of a loved one by buying this.  Avoid at ALL costs.

These were perfect for the price, as they are the only jack stands that have the pin style locking as well as the regular type.  I was using these to hold up my 03 Maxima and they worked just fine.  I've seen some people on here say the welds were bad, I think they just got a bad set.  These jack stands are sold everywhere, including Home Depot and they're sold for the same price but for ONE jack stand, not two, but, the welds on mine were good.  Also, I saw one guy wrote he had a van up on them and they failed. These are some pretty diesel jack stands, they dwarf the stands I got with my 3 ton jack a few years ago.  I'm wondering if they were being used properly, or who knows, maybe one out of every hundred they make is defective, who knows.  All I can tell you is, mine work great, and for the cost, I would absolutely recommend to family and friends.

Got my jack stands today, despite warnings about bad welds and poor quality. I think they're pretty nice. No, the welds aren't perfect, but more than adequate for the task. They will likely hold after the sheet steel of the stands buckles under too much weight. I don't know that I'd crawl under a 5 ton truck held up by these stands, but one end of a car is not going to make these stands fail.Until today, all I had on hand was a floor jack, and I was quite uncomfortable under my Mini when I had to put more than my hands underneath.These will certainly alleviate any fear I had crawling under the car to work on it.The stands have a common assembly for holding the stands at different heights, and the added safety of a pin to lock them in place. Well worth the $20 sale price, or even the $25 regular price.Quite satisfied with this purchase.

After reading about a recent death by a car enthusiast working on his car using non-locking jack stands, I immediately decided to replace my non-locking jackstands with these locking jack stands.  Non-locking jackstands can collapse if the adjustment arm is accidentally bumped and pose a hazard if you're under the vehicle.These jack stands are high quality and lock so they can't collapse accidentally when you're under the vehicle.

They are OK jack stands nothing special. The only problems are that the double locking stick thing sometimes is not aligned properly and does not go in correctly. Also the legs are not flat when they wrap which could result in them sinking into your driveway or garage but that is not a problem for me because I primarily use them for a go kart and ATV but I have heard that it is good to get the ones with the flat legs because of those problems.

I'm completely confident while working under my wrangler with these stands holding it up.  They make my Torin 3 Ton jack stands look like toys, not only in size, but in fit and finish.  I have an un-natural fear of my jeep falling on me while I'm pulling, tugging, and hammering to get bolts out.  Zero concern with these holding it up.  They don't sway, shake, shimmy, or flinch and the double locking feature just makes me feel all the better.  Fantastic jack stands, don't forsee myself buying another pair for a long time.

I had to buy 4 jack stands to get a desent pair (returned the others). Its hard to get good quality jack stands, I have searched around for a while.The major quality issue with these jack stands is their welding. Either the welding is discontinuous/not finished to the end, or the weld have holes in them. The other issue is that some of these stands are very wobbly, and it has to do with the 4 legs not being the same length. When I got a pair that I thought had acceptable welds, I ended having to grind the legs to make them more stable. Afterwards, I spray painted them with several coats to prevent the metal from rusting. I think I now have desent jack stands.The last thing I want to say is that, dont decide to purchase these stands based off the double locking pin. As other posters have mentioned, you truly do get only minimal engagement between the pin and the teeth of the saddles. I dont think the pin would save you if for some reason the main locking mechanism of the jack stands failed.

I work on my auto from time to time and I wanted these as a second pair.I liked these due to their price and 6 ton rating.  My favorite feature was the locking safety pin, which seems to be a rarity these days.However, upon arrival the box was in good order and did not appear to be damaged.  One of the two stands had a bent / hard to move release arm.  After engaging this stand, setting the safety pin, and adding some weight  it gave way with a simple bump. I was very surprised as the safety pin was in and it still gave way.The other issue I had was very similar to others -- really bad / incomplete welds, and very poor workmanship.I don't believe this unit was damaged by shipping and I believe this to be an overall workmanship / quality issue.

They work but there are some issues with them. I have a pair craftsman 3 ton jack stands that are superior in quality, the welds on these jack stands are porous and poorly done compared to the craftsman stands which I own and paid the same price for. I bought these because of the "double locking" mechanism and Although the craftsman stands do not have this feature I feel much more confident working under the craftsman stands than these. Additionally, the pin mechanism in one of my jacks does not insert the entire way unless you mess with the arm and upon inspection when you get the pin in the hole the jack stand arm rests on the pin instead of the locking arm on the jack because of the poor precision of the cut out holes for the pin. I would return them but they work without the pin mechanism on cars and my craftsman jacks are high lift for my truck and do not work on cars.

Great units.  Nice and strong.  I have a Ram 1500 pick up and a Suburban 1500.  The jack stands fit under nicely with no increase to the height or sometimes 1-2 notches up. So they seem just the right size for these vehicles.  My neighbor has 2 cheaper units from h.frght (which I love to shop at) that he puts under a Ram 2500 diesel.... no way for me!!!!  I bought two at first and then a few weeks later ordered another 2 (from teh same supplier).  So now I have 4 of the same strong units (with the double locking pin) for a few bucks more. Can rotate tyres and perform other maintenance much easier having the whole vehile up on 4 stands.Overall very happy with both my purchases,  no problems with and part of the transaction.  Thank you!

I had an interesting situation in that I have a high clearance Jeep and a low clearance Toyota Camry.  These jacks can handle both cars very well.  Even at the lowest setting the camry is quite high off the ground.They are also large, much larger than your typical 3 ton ones.I wanted heavy duty ones and these are.

i study reviews and normally do my homework on products and decided i would try to start leaving reviews. the extra safety of the lock pin sold me on this pair. the pair is good for 6 tons and leave you with plenty of room under the vehicle to work. i really dont feel safe running the post all the way up on a 3 ton set so these 6 ton at only a couple clicks up is a great working height. the jacks have a little tab that people talk about bending in at the top and the stands have a warning sticker telling you to bend it. this tab only keeps you from picking it up with the post and the stand actually falling to the floor landing on a toe. with the locking pins in this prevents this so the tab isnt a big deal. now the stands actually warn against placing a pair on the front and back lifting the vehicle to be supported fully on jack stands now as for me thats what i thought they were for? just for your peace of mind i have had my mustang up on 4 of the stands for a solid month with no problems. i searched everywhere for these and amazon had the best deal with free shipping. hope this helps.

Replacing two pairs of similar jacks I've used for decades that died in a chemical spill. After reading all the one-star, "you will be crushed to death" reviews, I was a little wary about pulling the trigger on these, but reasoned that I could return them if I wasn't happy. I'm happy and I'm keeping them.Pros:* Double-locking feature is really cool. The pin is actually a wedge that engages the ratchet teeth on the post. When under load, the pin is locked into the ratchet teeth of the post.* The post saddle is shallow enough to bear against the pinch-weld lift points on our Honda Odyssey and Accord without touching the surrounding sheet metal or plastic.* All welds are continuous and perfectly serviceable on the 4 units I got. I say this not as a certified welder, but as a guy who grew up in machine/fab shops.* 3 of 4 units stand flat with no rocking. 1 unit rocked by 1/16". Not enough for me to send back.* Lift range is 11 1/4" to 16 3/4". Great for getting under both of our Hondas.Cons:* As noted, 1 unit rocked by 1/16". I would've used it as-is, but I touched it with my bench grinder and it stands flat now.* One of the pins didn't insert completely. I popped off a tiny ball of painted welding splatter with a box knife. Fixed.Overall, these jack stands are a good value. I expect them to give me years of service.

These things are solid and huge.  Work well on my full size Chevy truck, but are not well-suited to a compact pickup.  I use a bottle jack, not a speed jack, so I rely exclusively on my stands to carry the load while I'm under the truck.  I keep one in the back of the truck at all times.

These looked great. They were packaged kinda funny and banged around a bit, causing a little bit of scratching. They seem well built and overall look like a solid product. The only thing that seems a bit off is the quality of the welds and the thickness of the actual red (A) part of the stand, it's pretty thin. I can only hope it passed destructive testing as is. I look forward to using these. These are a requirement if you need to get the car high enough to pull a tranny.I'll put it to use then update this at a later time.

As for quality, sure it isn't top notch. But this thing isn't going to fall apart on you, these are tough and will hold. Scared for you life? Than go to a shop. The welding isn't perfect, but you have to realize this is mass produced. The welds aren't going to separate. I would definitely suggest using these in pairs, as in don't leave one alone to hold part of your vehicle. For those with cars, don't worry b/c cars weigh nothing. These are rated for as much as a cars avg weight. The double locking is a nice feature but not necessary on small jobs. My truck weighs over 6k so if these can hold one end, it will hold your average cars then too. If your doing small jobs, get these b/c theres no beating the price.

I gave these a low rating because they are not well described. They are quality stands but they are NOT for cars. You'd think they would've written the height in the description or say that it is for trucks/SUVs only. They are extremely tall (even at the lowest setting), and I couldn't get them under my car.

I was leery of purchasing these as there were no dimensions listed.  I already had a pair of 2 ton jacks; was looking for bigger 3 tons for my full size pickup.  They arrived on time but upon inspection they were the exact same size as my 2 tons (height, width, craftsmanship).  The only difference was the insert lug.  It was about 1/8&#34; thicker.  I guess that's were the increased capacity comes from.  But again, being same size and limitations as my 2 tons...they didn't meet my needs.

BAD PRODUCT, WRONG WELDED, ITS ONLY WELD INSIDE, BUT NOT OUT SIDE,SO IS NOT RECOMENDED TO USE IT UNDER CAR. PLEASE DONT MAKE MY MISTAKE, IS NOT WELD RIGHT.THIS ITEM HAVE TO BE WELD IN BOTH SIDE, INSIDE AND OUT SITE, NOT ONLY INSIDE.THE PIN OR SECOND SAFETY PIN IS NOT GOOD AT ALL, IT MOVE AND DOES NOT HOLD THE POST RIGHT, ITS LIKE NOTHING, SO DOES NOT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE IT.--- TORIN WANTS TO SEND IT BACK EVERY YEAR FOR ANNUAL INSPECTION,BUT THEY DONT PAY FOR S/H. THIS SHOUL BE 1 TON, NOT 3 TON WITH THIS WELD FORM.MY ITEM LOOK USED NOT NEW, LOOK'S LIKE SOME ONE USE IT AND RETURNED AND THEN, THEY SENT THEM TO ME.  THE UPS DROP IT TO THE FLOOR, CAUSE I HAVE A GATE, SO BE AWARE OF UPS, THEY DONT CARE IF THEY BRAKE IT.
