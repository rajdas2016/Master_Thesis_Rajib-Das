The material is breathable and has a mesh inner lining to help airflow.  The pants fit just right and have a reinforced rear end for wear and tear and reinforced inner legs for engine heat.Here's what I was looking for and this suit had it:A full velcro flap on the front of the jacket.A velcro collar with a corduroy liner and a concealed hoodVelcro cuffsA drawstring waist and jacket bottomHighly visible during reduced visibility rain stormsThe pants come with bootstraps to keep them down and zippers by the cuffs to allow ease in putting on and taking off.3M reflective striping throughout the top and bottomSuspenders to keep the pant waistband up and under the coat.If you get a one-piece suit you'll be most protected since there's no break in material.  If you have a two-piece suit you don't want rain coming in between the pants and the coat.  So it was important to me to find a set that had suspenders or a bib on the pants to keep them tucked up under the coat.  These do just that.As for fit, I'm 5'11\" 185lbs.  I wear a medium in most clothing.  I wanted a suit that would fit over my clothes.  So I ordered a large.  A large on my frame fits over my jeans perfectly.  The rain coat fits perfectly over my leather jacket.  If I were to just wear the rain coat over my shirt, I would want a medium.  But because I always use my leather coat when riding, I needed a large size suit to go over my leather jacket.  The collar is the only snug part of the jacket.  It probably should be the only snug part anyway to keep rain from running down your neck.Mobility is fine in the suit.  I can twist my torso and look over my shoulders with very mild resistance from the material.Bottom line: This 2-piece suit is a good buy.  It has suspenders to keep the pants up.  It's high-visibility green.  It fits great over clothes and a leather jacket.  The inner mesh liner provides adequate breathability.  The price is reasonable compared to other competitors.  I have NOT rain tested this material.  But I'm familiar with the material in general and believe it will provide acceptable coverage.  The product claims to be seam-sealed so that no water will leak in.  If it ends up leaking one could easily buy some seam sealing glue from your local Camping store.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Exactly what I needed", "unixReviewTime": 1368316800, "reviewTime": "05 12, 2013"}

His efforts and skills on two more recent CD's called \"New York City\" and \"Chance and Circumstance,\" are remarkable.  On these, his guitar work is among the best I've ever heard.

How did the Rolling Stones (as young kids) produce the Let It Bleed and Sticky Fingers albums, but then struggle to ever produce anything like them ever again?

In the case of Peter Malick, there is still hope.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt because \"Wrong Side of My Life\" and \"Sons of The Jet Age\" were his first two attempts.

Granted, the installation was difficult but that's because of having to work in a cramped space and at awkward angles.  One job I'd never want to have is an automobile electronics installer!  But if you follow the directions step by step, and get the wiring chart for your vehicle from Bulldog's web site, the unit should work.  Mine worked the first time and I'm happy with it.  The programming is a little convoluted but without any external switches or interfaces, I guess button pushing sequences is all that's left.  I was skeptical about Bulldog's method for splicing wires (no soldering or crimp connectors) but it works and you don't have to cut and splice any wires.  They provide a little voltage tester that was a big help.  Its a probe with an alligator clip on one end and an LED at the other end and it was very helpful in finding the correct wires.

I personally can not comment on the technical support staff, as I never found it necessary to contact them.I started by pulling up my wiring diagram (a 2004 Chevy Cavalier) and printing it out.  Later that night, starting at around 11:00pm, I began the installation process.  The instillation was a snap, the only difficulties I ran in to were the wires hiding WAY up on the body control module, which was an issue with the car, not the starter.  After only 2 hours, having never installed a remote starter in my life, along with a fuel system bypass module, I pressed the start button and just like that, first shot, the vehicle started.I have since installed the starter in two separate vehicles.  One vehicle belonging to a friend, and a second vehicle of mine.  The install in my second vehicle (a '97 Dodge Ram Sport full-size pickup) took around an hour and a half.  Again, once all wires were connected, first touch of the button and I heard the pipes singing.Of course, this starter does not have all the bells and whistles of other models out there, but for the price, you can't expect it to have all the other features.  Aside from the range (which is greatly increased by following instructions and keeping the antenna away from the frame, and also by mounting it to a third party antenna**), I would recommend it to anyone who wants a reliable remote vehicle starter.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Instillation was a snap.", "unixReviewTime": 1139097600, "reviewTime": "02 5, 2006"}

But if you're looking at getting this alarm, you don't own some exotic car that's worth tons of money.  You'd be looking at a lojac (sp?)  system or something like that.  More than likely, you have an ordinary car,  and you don't even know if you want to use the alarm, but you want to save  some money on your car insurance.  And if that's what you're after, this  alarm definitely does the trick.  And if you want a bit of safety to go  along with it, this will work too.First off, the warning about the  warranty card is true.  You have seven days to send it in, so make sure you  stick a stamp on and get it out pronto.I can't say that this alarm is so  much quieter than it's supposed to be, because the first thing I thought  when turning it on was &quot;dang, can't this thing be quieter?&quot;  So  if it's in your garage or driveway, don't worry, you'll hear it.  And if  somebody jumps on your car to sit on it, they'll hear it too!Next, if  you read about the &quot;7 talking messages&quot;, and thought it would say  things like &quot;you're too close to the car,&quot; etc, you're wrong.  Part of the 7 messages are &quot;armed&quot;, &quot;disarmed&quot;,  &quot;please set the alarm now (or something like that)&quot;, etc.The  system is easy to set up, but the 10 minutes may be pushing it.  I think it  took more than 10 minutes alone to figure out where the thing will fit in  my car!  You'll need to have an electric drill, as you'll be going directly  into the metal of the car with the screws.  When you pick a location, keep  in mind that there's 2 parts to the alarm, the base &amp; the body, and  you'll need to detatch those to get the base secured to the car, but then  reattach them.  That can be a pain if it's in a wrong location.  Otherwise,  you plant the base, reattach the body, and then there's an alligator clip  that stretches to the car battery, hook that up, and you're done, other  than setting the alarm.All in all, you can save 25% off of your comp  portion of your car insurance, and get a little piece of mind.

Wheels that have specific drivers written for them have better control, hands down. My other complaint is that it uses the game port instead of a USB connection, which also slows down the response time of the wheel and other controls, but since this is a budget-priced product I can forgive that. Playing NFS: Porsche Unleashed with this wheel was frustrating to say the least, and after switching to a sidewinder game pad, I had better control by far. If you can drive better with a game pad instead of a wheel then there is something definately wrong with the wheel.The other problems with this wheel are the small wheel size, which may cause problems with large-handed people, and the placement of the two buttons on the wheel, which can be hit very easily by accident, possibly causing problems if either are configured for a hand-brake or to view another direction. Also, the VERY light and small pedal base needs to be braced or weighted down somehow or it will slide all over the place (may work all right on carpet, but on a chair mat or any other smooth flooring will cause a problem). My last complaint is the quality (or lack there of) and flimsiness of the levers on the left and right behind the wheel, typically used for gear shifting up and down. I thought I was going to break these the first time I tested the wheel. The cheap plastic won't last long at all under heavy usage and it won't make you happy to have to wait for a warranty repair (though as cheap as this wheel is you will probobly just get another one).If you want a quality wheel, you probobly won't be happy with this one. I suggest a USB port wheel, like the Thrustmaster Nascar Pro Digital, also available here, which is about as good as they come. Things to look for are a large heavy pedal base, a dual clamping wheel base (though the Saitek wheels' one clamp worked very well), and multiple configurable buttons on the wheel (two just doesn't cut it for most games and you will still be utilizing the keyboard), as well as a separate gearshift (unleass you prefere to always go automatic). I usually don't recommend a force-feedback wheel because all the ones I have tried become more annoying after a while and certainly don't immerse me into the game anymore than not using the force-feedback functions, but thats just me.I hope this more detailed review helps you out with your purchase and have fun!", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "I highly recommend paying extra to get a better wheel!", "unixReviewTime": 994118400, "reviewTime": "07 3, 2001"}

For the price of a set of cheap Booster/Jumper Cables in a brick and morter store, you can buy extra long and heavy duty jumpers!  First off, don't be the person that not only needs to ask a kind passer-by for a \"jump\" but also if they have jumper cables.  It's MUCH easier to get a jump start if you have your own cables.Next lets talk about sizing.  Having the longest cable possible is a major plus if your car is parked up against something like a pole or wall, or even parked on a one way street.  The \"booster car\" (the car w/o a dead battery) can pull in close enough to use the cables without having to manuver into some akward position.  Or better yet, you won't have to push your vehicle into a position to be jumped.  If your diving a normal sized car they can even pull in behind you to jump you!  Or if their vehicle is the shorter of the two, they could pull in front.  Now how about gauge?  For those who aren't electricians or engineers, as the number value of gauge decreases, the size and capacity of the cable increases.  So for example 6-ga has about twice as much copper wire as 8-ga, and 4-ga is a about twice as much as 6-ga, so on and so on.  That doesn't mean you double the capacity of wire with every two numbers though.  4-gauge may sound like a lot but it really isn't.The technical stuff.  Don't worry if this doesn't make sense, you don't really need to know all of this, but I'm trying to make a point as to why to get the longest and heavist cables you can.  I'm not an electrican but I've worked with it long enough to know a few general rules of thumb.  First of the enemy of electricty is resistance.  Resistance ultimately determines the load a particular wire can carry.  Five things factor into resistance.  Temperature, conductor, voltage, load, and distance.  Temp we can't control, so we have to assume the worst (HOT)...or in other words need heavier cable.  Conductor should be copper, or at least a high purity mix of copper...good there.  Voltage...12VDC is a low voltage system...probably the biggest problem we face.  Since is a low voltage system we have to contend with voltage drop as it travels over the wire.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run with acceptable levels of voltage drop over a particular gauge wire...so again since it's low voltage need heavier gauge wire.  Load (Amperage)...it's a car starter so it takes A LOT of power.  The voltage is a fixed number (more or less) so Amperage is determined by the size of the engine your trying to start.  And you'd be surprised how high that can be.  Even a small engine can be well over 300 Cranking Amps.  That said even a \"dead\" battery will put out some power.  As for distance...this cables selling point is also a draw back.  25' is LONG run for 12VDC.  So like I said in the last line 4-ga isn't as much as you think.  In fact, if you have an engine over 6-liters you should really consider 2-ga for this distance.  So summing up in layman's terms...considering the hot temperatures outside, the fact that it's 12VDC and we need a long cable, and that we're trying to start a car engine (which takes a LOT of power) these are the ONLY cables I could reccomend for anyone driving a small car up to a light truck.Lets talk about how to properly start a car with a drained battery.  Make sure the LAST connection make is the NEG clamp to the \"dead\" car on a frame ground (something metal and NOT MOVING or GOING TO MOVE in the engine compartment.)  Don't attach it directly to the battery's NEG post.  Next lightly rev the engine of the running vehicle for 3 to 5 minutes.  This will put a bit of a surface charge on the dead battery.  Then attempt to start the car.  As soon as it starts remove the cables (starting with the NEG on the car being jumped.)  If you ever have a dead battery for any reason...take it to an auto parts store as soon as possible and have it tested to make sure it still holds a proper charge.  Most places do it for free.  NEVER touch the clamps together once connected to a battery!!!  Doing so could damage you vehicles electrical system, and/or cause fire, burns, explosion of the battery, damages to your cables...A couple of final thoughts.  Protect your investment.  I bought a cable bag that works really well to keep them from getting tangled with everything in my trunk.  Also keep the twist ties that come with them which will keep them organized inside the cable bag.  And once used, take them home and clean and dry them before storing them once again.  The oils inside of engine compartments can be corrosive to rubber jackets and copper contacts.  These cables are more than worth they weight in gold!

I went to my battery manufacturer's website and coleman cable's website to look up the information. After much research, my understanding is that the higher the am-page rating, the better chance you will start your car in cold weather, usually a new car battery has 350-400A Cold Crank Ampage (CCA). Since these cables are made of Copper Clad Aluminum (also abbreviated as CCA coincidentally), their ampacity are only equivalent to 1 gauge lower diameter pure copper wire ( search 'Ampacity of Copper & Aluminum Wire, it's published in the NEC code). What's more with longer cable the resistance also goes up so you will loss some ampacity along the way. My experience with Coleman's 8 Guage 12' cable is that unless I attach to the dead battery's negative post, it won't deliver enough juice to start the car by connecting to the engine block ground point to my Honda Civic (mid size car use 400A CCA battery), so my assumption is anything has current rating less than 200A can't be used without acting against the label warning by connecting to the dead battery's negative post.

Coleman seems to be a well respected company. After inspecting the 08660 twenty foot long four gauge cables, I am satisfied with my purchase.

There is a top of page review dated September 14th 2006 by Privacy Advocate titled \"Slight disappointment\" in which he describes his concern about the clamps having only one side of the jaw plated with copper. This actually is an intelligent design. The copper cable is connected to only one jaw (the jaw that is copper plated for increased conductivity). Copper plating the non-connected jaw would be counter productive. I recommend purchasing a minimum length of twenty feet, a minimum of four gauge cable, and clamps rated a minimum of 500 amps. The length is recommended because you may not always be able to place a boost vehicle nose to nose or side by side. The gauge and amps are particularly important if you live in a cold climate.

The clips are decent and will work on most if not all battery set-ups you come across; they grab tightly but are not too hard for the average person to squeeze open.The wire is crimped to the jaws and but the instalated part of the wire is not also crimped. There is a place on the jaws to crimped the insulated portion (which would then act as a stress relief) but it is not used. You can crimp it with a pair of pliers when you get the cables -- just tight enough to grab the cable is all you need -- this will prevent the cables form breaking away where the aluminum is crimpt to the metal.Jaw markings-- there are three types of markings boasted by the maker: First is Color -- Indeed one can easily identify one side of the paired cable form the other by the color of the jaws.Second - Indent stamping -- the polarity is stamped into the metal jaws -- The imprint is not disticnt and not very easy to read in good light. At night, it would be useless and one couldn't read the impression by feel. So these are practically useless.Third -- Phosphorescent labeling -- phosphorescence stores up energy for a short while after strong light exposure and slowly sheds the energy as dim light. So, if you put the cables in the sun for a while, the labels will glow for few minutes. This would help you if you need to jump your battery at night only if you have some sunlight to hold the cables under for a while. Most people will keep the cables in their trunk anyway, where it is genrally dark, so the cables won't have been recently exposed to a lot of sunlight. I suppose one could hold them in front of the car headlights for a few minutes and then moved away from the headlights and quickly read the labels, that would work. But then, why not just read the color of the clips while holding them in front of the headlights? The phosfluoresecnt labels are just a silly useless sales come-on.They are not, but even if the labels were made with tritium capsules -tritium is a radiant ionic form of Hydrogen (used sometimes on wristwatches -- the tritium is spent after a few years. The notion of glowing labels on booster cables borders on idiotic.If you have trouble remembering which color to use for positive or negative, just remember that it doesn't matter! What matters is that the same color going to positive on one battery goes to positive on the other. You could use black for positive if you want or red.You always double the consistency of polarity before attaching the fourth clip. Even if they glow in the dark, have marquee lights blinking messages or they sing \"I'm positvely in love with you\".These cables are for consumer (i.e., ocassional) use. For daily, professional use, you'll want real copper cables because copper doesn't corrode or fatigue as easily as aluminum. That's not an issue for cables receiving ocassional use. With ocassional use these will serve most motorists for a lifetime and serve well for the money even overlooking the silliness about the clip labels.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good at the price but some flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1382054400, "reviewTime": "10 18, 2013"}

Aluminum has a higher resistance than copper, so the same gauge cable will conduct less current. 6-gauge should be sufficient for small and medium cars, where the starting current is not tremendously high - it may not be sufficient for large trucks or tractors, especially in cold weather.

Good length, good ga. wire and copper connectors. But for me where they fall short is at the clamps and this type of clamp seems to be on MANY cables available today. I could not see it in the photos but the clamps are uneven at the ends because of the extra notch the manufacturer adds on one side to make it easier to connect to side terminal batteries. Also there are NO teeth on the end of the jaws so you HAVE to make your connection using the teeth on the sides of the jaws.  This does not sound like a big deal until you are in a tight situation and have to clamp onto a top post battery straight down, then you have an uneven clamp end and no teeth to grip the post.  I happen to also have a car (a domestic) with a remote mounted battery, not a HOT ROD or modified car, just a stock factory production car where the manufacturer could not fit the battery under the hood for space saving and design reasons and put it elsewhere in the car.  Remote batteries used to be a rare thing on mostly European cars but it is fairly common now on all makes of cars.  With the battery not under the hood or in the trunk I have a Pos. and Neg. lug under the hood at the end of battery cables to jump the car with.  The Pos. lug is surrounded by plastic in a depression to prevent anything from accidentally hitting it and shorting.  Because of this there is little room and I can not get the side of these jumper cable clamps to grab the lug, I need teeth on the end of the jaws to grip the Pos. lug. I'm returning these cables and for $15 more (on sale) than the price of these cables I got the same length, the same 4 ga. wire, clamps with teeth on all 3 sides, even jaw ends, a side terminal connection in the jaws, and they came with a hard plastic storage case, safety glasses and gloves. After shopping around for a week I found this is a great deal.  I shopped all over the Net and in my local stores comparing prices wire length, size, and end clamps.

I don't care what anyone says. Cars are low voltage but high amperage. A starter cranking needs a TON of juice. Those dainty little WM cables will not cut it.

THESE are jumper cables.  Let me explain.When you're in a bind on some dark night in some parking lot somewhere and your battery is dead, you need to get out of there pronto.In times like that, it's much easier to get a jump if YOU own a set of jumper cables.  It's double good if those jumper cables are long so that they can easily reach the battery of a good samaritan.  Now, according to electrical theory in order for DC current to flow across long distances, you need thicker cable.That's where these cables come in, they're long at 25' and thick at 2gauge.That's what these cables provide, maximum length at near maximum gauge cable.  And yes, your jumper cables SHOULD cost close to as much as your spare tire because that's what you need --- just look up the cost of copper on the market (that stuff is expensive).Yes, you can buy a $17 set of 10 foot, 18 gauge cables out there but if they can't reach between cars or if they can't carry enough power to start your car, you might as well have been lugging a brick in your trunk all those years and you might as well have enjoyed a good lunch with the $17 for all the false confidence it gave you.  I'm serious, buy an extension cord for $5 and you get as much jumping potential as many of the so called 'jumper' cables on the market --- there should be laws against marketing products that cannot jump start a car.  Worse, having no cables or less-than-worthless cables means that a criminal might reach you before you can get a jump and make your getaway.At the end of the day, you want a 25' or 20' cable, so you better be looking at 2gauge or 4 gauge cable - no compromises there.  You can go to 6gauge if you're working your way down to 16' cables.  But, the reality is that you always need a few extra feet when trying to jump start someone's car parked in some tight parking space --- so you're back to the 25' and 2 gauge.Pros- I know I can jump start a Semi with these (more importantly, I can get a jump from a Semi - Truck drivers are the good guys btw)- Extra long at 25'- Parrot clamp are strong, but an average guy can open them with one hand- Copper inserts in the parrot clamps is nice- Clamps are rated at 500amps- they're friggin heavy at near 14lbs, yes that's a pro!  that means there's 14 POUNDS of Copper in there and that's what allows the current to flow as freely as the Amazon river (no pun intended). It's huge.Cons- I do have an issue that the copper cable is not attached to the copper inserts in the clamps, it screws into the metal clamp rather than into the copper insert.  I don't know if that's a mistake or not.  I'm thinking about doing a bit of retrofitting.  I'm sure it's more than enough the way it is.Overall, these are as close an approximation to the kind of jumper cables that my dad had when I was growing up.  He custom made his -- he's old school.Anyway, if you're going to carry jumper cables, and you should --- don't muck around -- spend the dough, get these --- they'll last a lifetime and will not let you down.Advice, after you get a jump don't waste time rolling these things up in some dark parking lot -- just toss the heavy mangled mess into your trunk and get home.

For that you'll have to go to an electrical or welding supply company and you will PAY!  Probably between 3 and 5 times what these cost!  So unless you plan to start a towing service and need cables that will see daily use, I'd say these are gonna work for you.(Update: After compairing them to the 4ga cables I bought a month or so back for my car, they don't really seem that much thicker...  That's said they are MUCH heavier!  The individual stranding is of a thicker gauge than the other model so I'm guessing that's why the thickness isn't much more...)What I like:--Length - I bought these for a half-ton pickup.  Why?  Because it never fails that your battery will fail to start your engine when your parked in a packed lot with cars on all sides.  Rather than pushing a 3 ton vehicle out you pull the booster vehicle in as close as you can and let the length work for you.--Heft - these cables are no joke.  It's a workhorse grade cable that lets plenty of energy flow.  When trying to start a 5.7L V8, that's kinda important.--Solid Clamps - Unlike some of the other reviews, I don't have a problem opening my parrot clamps with one hand.  But their hardly weak, they'll clamp solid and stay put!(Update: If you really need 2ga booster cables and your skeptical of these, Deka makes a set of 2ga cables for around $150.  I have no personal experence with them but I have a little with the Deka name and they seem pretty good.)What I don't like:--Stiffness - They're not as flexible as I was hoping.  But about as flexible as I expected.  True welding cable in 2ga is about $3 per foot and per cable.  That's why the best jumper cables cost $200+.  Still I was hoping for a little thinner stranding to promote flexibilty.--Cable to Clamp - Like other reviews have mentioned the cable doesn't go all the way to a copper contact connected to the jaws.  Instead.  It's screwed to the body of the clamp then the copper jaws are also screwed to the body.  Still fine I'm sure.So why buy these cables aren't they overkill?  I've had this argument with people before: \"My 6ga cheapies start my truck fine.\"  Well I will attempt to addess this.  As the number in terms of gauge decreases the ammount of conductor increases.  In other words 2ga has more (perhaps 50-100% more) conductor than 4ga.  This doesn't automatically equate to twice as much power but it does certainly allow more power to flow safely.  For those that aren't aware (and I'm not an electrical engineer here), resistance is the enemy of all electrical circuts.  Resistance translates to heat in the same way that friction does when two physical surfaces rub together.  Five basic factors contribute to resistance in a give curcuit and determine the appropriate line size.  Ambient temperature, conductor, line distance, voltage, and amperage.  Ambient temp we have no control over.  Hot is bad so just assume the worst.  This means bigger cable to overcome the additon resistance heat is producing.  Conductor of these is copper so that's good.  You want pure or at least a high purity mix of copper in this type of conductor.  Distance and voltage.  One of these cable's strengths also happens to be a weakness.  Total run length for this circut is 50'.  Pretty long for a low voltage system like 12VDC.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run on a given gauge wire without encountering too much voltage drop.  12VDC drops voltage on a circuit in a realatively short distance.  So heaiver gauge lines are needed to prevent this.  Amperage is also a big consideration.  The more amps a load pulls the more resistance the circut will generate.  Basically on a small wire, a large load will generate a lot of heat and one of two things will happen. 1) the wire will melt and/or catch on fire.  2) The load your trying to power won't work.  And make no mistake, starting even a small engine takes a LOT of energy!  So bringing it all together.  Large load, low voltage (that we don't want to make in lower), and a long distance run means that you wan the heaviest cables you can find.  Addressing the orignal question and statment.  6' 6ga cables might start your small-block fine.  But if you want or need the extra length, you need to consider heavy gauge cables.  That said I've personally seen light duty cables melt and smoke from starting an engine too big for them.Are these right for you?  So these will run you close to $100 shipped...do you actaully need them?  I own both these and the Coleman 4ga 25' booster cables.  Having no offical training and with no real sizing charts on the packaging I would say this.  The 4ga will do you fine at the 25' length for engines up to 5-liters or so (and honestly probably up to about 6L as well.)  Anything bigger than that and you should be considering these or something even better.Also protect your investment.  Buy a cable bag for them to keep them neat and protected.  Also keep the twist ties that came with them to keep them organized inside your bag.  I have the Arsenal #5888 cable organizer and it works great for this.  Remember too to clean and inspect your cables after each use to prolong their life and keep you safe.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Not sure if they're really 2ga", "unixReviewTime": 1292976000, "reviewTime": "12 22, 2010"}

Ross \"Engineer\"", "helpful": [0, 1], "reviewText": "A bought a Whistler Pro-1600 Watt Power Inverter from Amazon and needed a convenient way to hook it up to my vehicle's battery.  A key issue with such inverters is minimizing the voltage drop between the battery and the inverter to avoid low-voltage trip-outs where the inverter's input voltage drops below the inverter's minimum allowable input voltage.  Thus, I needed a good low-voltage-drop cable with good clamps for attaching to the battery.  The far end of the cable was going to be cut off and the cable connected to the inverter with new swagged-on terminals (Thomas-&Betts; #4 AWG - 54106).What I found was that this cable is not pure copper...it's roughly half the conductivity of copper for the same diameter...but works pretty well.  As part of my tests with the 1600-watt inverter, I carefully measured the various voltage drops in the cable circuit for a constant 100 amp current.  These were quite illuminating!  For the as-delivered Jumpers (two cables, 40 feet round-trip between source battery and the being-jumped-battery, the voltage drops were as follows:  Battery terminal to jumper copper jaws (all four clamps totaled)=0.2 volts &#34;surprisingly low to me.&#34;  Battery copper jaws to cable attachment to clamps=0.13 volts &#34;could have been eliminated by attaching cable directly to copper jaws like some cables do, but not a big deal.&#34;  Round trip voltage drop down the jumper cable itself (40 feet total R/T distance)=1.77 volts.  Thus the total voltage drop was 2.1 volts for 100 amp current.  This is starting to be significant, but probably OK.For my application I shortened the cables to 5 1/2 feet (11 feet round trip) and swagged on the terminals on the other end using a Harbor-Freight hydraulic cable crimper (Model 66150 w/ #0 die).  The swagged fittings came out perfect with only a 0.001 volt drop from cable to fitting and another 0.002 volt drop through the bolt terminal to the inverter.Bottom Line:  I'm VERY happy with the overall results...though I'd prefer to have the cables be pure copper...and thus lower voltage drop.  The Inverter worked like a champ with the cables...no low voltage trips even with very large start-up currents (3 HP, 16&#34; electric chain saw)...this was just a test, but I was impressed!  My objective is to use the inverter with a smaller Remington 8-amp 10&#34; electric chain saw...its works perfectly on the inverter.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good Jumpers, & Good Source of Cable", "unixReviewTime": 1398124800, "reviewTime": "04 22, 2014"}

My generator has been hard-starting since new, with no adjustments, plug changes, or anything else making any difference whatsoever.  (And the gas has a preservative in it.)  I absolutely cannot pull-start mine unless the engine is hot.  Because of this, I start mine with the electric starter and always keep a battery charger attached.  The good news is that it always starts without fail and runs smoothly immediately on starting, even though I have to crank it a bit. Starting is pretty much the same in warm temps or sub-zero.I bought this generator because of its excellent reputation for clean power and for its ability to handle surge demand - important for a backup generator as you don't want power to sag too far when motors in well pumps and furnaces kick on.  The generator motor is brushless and high quality.  The engine is built for long life and my direct experience has proven that out, having had to run through outages lasting days.  It is also reasonably quiet given that it is an open frame design.The 6600 is heavy.  I highly recommend getting the mobility kit.  As an FYI, the frame has a lifting eye on top - very handy if you have the ability to take advantage of it.My generator panel carries the well pump, 1st floor furnace, refrigerator and freezer, pellet stove, a selection of light circuits, and a few other circuits.  I start the generator with all circuits running motors off, switching them in 1 minute increments to offset any starting loads.  The switching sequence is kept on a list in the panel.I'm not sure what direction I'd go if I bought another generator.  On one hand, it would be convenient to have a built-in, whole-house unit.  Then again, they are expensive and you leave those behind when you move.  Another direction would be an inverter-based unit.  The advantage there is cleaner power, but they have a higher risk of breakdown (more electronics).  Pick your compromise, I guess.  A high-quality, air-cooled, open frame generator is an excellent choice, but you need to put the emphasis on quality when you buy.  Pass the discount and home center brands by and pick up something like the Yamaha, a Honda, or an Onan.This is an excellent generator, though I have to knock it down to 4 stars because of the starting issues I've experienced with my unit.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Reliable, Hard-Starting", "unixReviewTime": 1223856000, "reviewTime": "10 13, 2008"}

It is manufacturered by a well known inverter company.  I frequently use mine to power a TV and VCR in a motorhome, although I've used it for some other things. It is easily able  to power a small appliance (but not high wattage ones like a hairdrier) or  a small computer.One thing you have to be aware of when using an  inverter is DC current draw.  Say you use your Statpower to power three 100  watt bulbs.  That would be a little less than three amps at 120 volts, just  at the limit if its &quot;continuious&quot; rating.  It would be about 30  amps at 12 volts, and that is what your statpower will try to draw off of  your battery.  This may require a direct connection to your battery using  heavy wire (heavier that what is usually sold as jumper cable wire,  especially for long runs and continuious use), as opposed to using the  cigarette lighter socket and plug it comes with, and it may require some  planning - a couple of hours of this will completely drain a small car  battery.But if you plan for this, then an inverter is a lot cheaper  than buying hybrid appliances (12 volt+120 volt), and, for me, one inverter  was much cheaper than buying special 12 volt cords for laptops, cellphone  charging, gameboys, and other rechargable or low power items.  An inverter  like the Statpower 300 should have enough power for a gaggle of bricks, all  at once.Being from the USA, I took my Statpower 300 abroad.

It is rated at 300 Watts output, but that's only IF you cut the power cord and attach it directly to a 12v battery. Otherwise, according to the instruction book, it is only rated at 150 Watts. Now, if you have a shop and electrician's tools and know how to solder, then you're probably in fine shape. The extra pieces of equipment (inline switch, inline fuse, ring terminals) shouldn't be a major expense. Buying a solder gun and solder adds to the cost. And you may end up having to take it a shop to have them do all the connections if you suck at soldering. It can get expensive to turn this product in to the product it is advertised to be, easily another $15 to $30. The actual manufacture costs of putting in the inline switch and fuse and providing ring terminal connections, probably would have cost the manufacturer an extra $1.50, but that would cut into their profit margine too much. So you end up with a product which, to be used as advertised, has to modified at extra expense and time (and a lot of running around to hardware stores trying to find the parts and the tools). I am inclined to return it, simply because it IS NOT ready to be used as it is represented. I don't even know if the product works. Once I cut the power cord to make it functional as represented (300 Watts), I can probably no longer return it (it may even void the warranty). So I am stuck with a dilemma ... return it, and buy a product that is REALLY a 300 Watt inverter, or try to modify it so that I can use it at the rated power. It is definitely false advertising. And I don't consider educational experiences like this anything more than frustrating and annoying. If you're an electrician, then you probably won't have any problems (on the other hand, if you're an electrician, you probably won't be needing/wanting such a small unit anyway).

I bought mine primarily so that I could plug stuff into my car lighter outlet during long trips (e.g., portable TV, portable CD/VCD player, etc.), so I did some research.  What I found out is that although the inverter supports up to 300 watts (continuous use), most car lighter outlets support only 150 watts.  Thus, having a power inverter greater than 150 watts is only useful if you plan to hook it up directly to your battery (which is why power inverters usually come with clamps to attach to your car battery terminals).  If you use more than 150 watts while plugged into your car's lighter outlet, you're likely to fry the outlet and/or the inverter.Therefore, if you're planning to use your inverter on camping trips (perhaps plugging in a portable stove or something directly to your battery), or if you hope to use this for emergencies (e.g., power failures) during which you use your car battery as an electrical source, then this product is for you (just be sure to stay within the watt limits--it's usually printed on the device that you're hoping to use).

Amazon is selling a remote faceplate along with the prosine inverters.  YOU DON'T NEED TO BUY IT.  The inverters come with a built in faceplate and 4 screws - remove the screws and insert a male-female modular phone cable to extend the remote control to wherever you want it.  Amazon did remove the cautions about generators, so I am removing my paragraph about the difference in generators and inverters.  My pro-sine 1000w nominal, 1500w peak has proven to be as reliable as a power outlet in my home, and in analyzing the power quality with fluke tools it is equal to or better than the power from the grid, which says alot.Note - when this was written the price was $549 and was the best deal on the net.  Amazon has raised their price but the Xantrex prosine series is still in the top tier of inverters.  Also note that Amazon's description makes reference to a staged charger - the prosine series HAS NO CHARGER and is reliant upon an external charger (alternator, AC, or solar etc) so amazon should correct their description.  I later purchased a D31M Optima battery and a 1.5 Farad capacitorOptima Batteries  OPT D31M  Group 31 Marine Battery, BlueTopPOWER ACOUSTIK 1.0 FARAD Digital Power Capacitor (POWER ACOUSTIK PC10F)to improve the surge performance of this inverter for starting an air compressor.  I also added a 50 foot 10/3 extension cord to use with it so that power would not be wasted in the extension see:Coleman Cable 10/3 50-Foot Vinyl Outdoor Extension Cord #02688-88-02Updated 1/2008.  Using these add-ons makes a very functional 1000W continuous inverter with 1500 watt surge capability that operates in my car and doesn't complain what I operate from it.(paragraph wondering why amazon put generator info on this product now removed - it is not a generator - it converts 12 volts DC from a battery or car alternator to 117 VAC with a true sinewave output that won't damage delicate appliances)PROS:Lets start positive:  Inverters are almost silent.  They make a very very slight buzzing sound on the poor quality models, but a true sine wave inverter is almost completely silent except for cooling fans which only come on under high power use and turn off when it is cold outside or you are running a transformer adapter)A true sine wave is just like the power that comes from the utility.  A modified sine wave is squared off without round corners - this causes heat generation in alot of electronic devices and can blow fusses even blow transformers.  For those non-electricians it's like using square tires on a car meant for round tires!  I have used alot of modified sine wave inverters in my time - they are much smaller, much cheaper, and tend to DESTROY your expensive electronics.  That is why I bought a TRUE sine wave inverter - the power is just like what comes from the wall socket, but you pay more for the inverter and get less power out.  It's a tradeoff that can save your valuable electronic parts.  For me, this one will drive > $250,000 in Agilent test and measurement gear in my truck, so $549, which is the best price around, is cheap! (revised: 1/08 not any more - several companies sell it for 599)  revised 08/09 - now they are $750 - inflation.OK - more pros - the Xantrex brand comes with a nice LCD display showing volts, amps, and watts.  This display can be removed and relocated in your vehicle with a simple telephone cord for $5. REVISED - YOU DON'T NEED TO BUY THE SEPARATE CONTROL PANEL - JUST RELOCATE THE BUILT IN ONE using a phone cord.  No exposed printed circuit boards are present and the remote display is self contained as it comes from the factory.  Other higher wattage Xantrex sinewave inverters do not include this display and sell it optionally for $400 alone.  Some sites advertise the display board as an optional item.  I don't know why - it comes with the inverter in the 1000/1800 watt variant.  Cheaper brands have red/green lights on the front that are permanent.  Like a fine auto, guages are essential to proper operation to know when your battery is dying or if you have a bad connection somewhere.  The LCD display shows Volts, Amps, and has a bargraph showing your instantaneous wattage including surge to 1500 watts.You should know the two prosine models (1000/1800 watt continuous) each come in 3 models - version 1 is hardwired for an RV by an electrician (no GFCI, conduit fittings in/out), version 2 is hardwired with an auto switchover when AC is present (just like a UPS but meant for LONG runtimes), and ver. 3 has a GFCI outlet on the front panel to just plug into but no AC connection at all.  This model is the 3rd variant.  You give it a 12VDC source and it gives you 1000 watts (1500 surge watts for a few seconds to start lights, motors, and such).  Keep in mind that to get 1500 surge watts, you need 150 amps at 11 or so volts.  That is not going to come from the cigarette lighter - this must be installed with heavy wire going to a top of the line battery as startup currents for some devices may be 130+ amps.  Motors and incandescent lights can draw as much as 10x their operating power at startup, which is why a good inverter gives you both max and surge values.Also use caution when buying any inverter - advertising will push the \"surge\" value which may be for only 1/2 second on some models (about 3 seconds on this one).  Your real operating power is the lower number.If you want one of the other models they are more expensive and you can add features later if you really need them, but its not an easy task.  Odds are you don't need these features but if you think you do, this is the wrong model - it is the entry level model w/o all the features.  There is also an 1800 watt version available for more money.  I bought this because of the value at the $549 pricepoint.  Today I'd probably buy the 1800 watt model as the prices are closer.  Everyone else is $680.  (note prices are higher now)Another \"PRO\" of this is the xantrex inverter has a power down (sleep) mode where it will wake up every 2.5 seconds and look for a load connected to it - if there is no load of 10 watts or more (i.e. lights are turned off) then it goes back to sleep for 2.5 seconds.  In this mode it only uses 1.5 watts from your batteries.  It's very efficient this way to not drain your batteries if you turn off your load when it is not in use.  Idiling (running the inverter without a load) takes about 22 watts instead of 1.5 watts in sleep mode.  You can turn sleep mode on or off if you want full power 100% of the time.  In sleep mode you will notice the NEON lights of your power strips blink every 2.5 seconds during sleep mode - that is the inverter searching for a load to run.Another design pro is the LCD dot matrix display can be removed and extended from the chassis for remote mounting (i.e. keep the inverter near your batteries and put the monitor near the drivers seat in an RV).  I used a $5 phone extention cable to do this.  If you plan to use it in a vehicle look into battery isolation modules - these allow your batteries to charge while driving and drain your EXTRA batteries with the inverter while not draining your engine starting battery (kinda important!) - I used a system like this to run an electric heater in my truck camper in the nevada winter - batteries charge during they day while driving and keep the truck warm at night, even running cooking tools for dinner.Back to the inverter, now let's address the cons.One sorta con and sorta pro is that the inverter is air cooled.  The fan is VERY fast.  Under light loads (50 watts or so) it doesn't even run the fan.  As soon as you run 1000 watts (ex: printing on a laser printer) it runs the fan at full speed.  In between it runs slower to minimize noise.  It's a good compromise between needlessly running the fan and quickly cooling the inverter under heavy load.Another con is that \"TRUE SINE\" inverters are not as efficient as \"Sorta Sine\" inverters are.  In a perfect world if we need 1 amp at 120V, it will take 10A at 12 V to get it.  Due to the fact that this not a perfect world, it's more like 14A at 12VDC to get 1A at 120VAC.  Because this inverter can make 8.3A @ 120V (8.3A x 120V ~= 1000W neglecting the power factor which is beyond this review's scope - google \"power factor\" to understand it.) You need 8.3 * 12-14A at 12VDC.  That's alot of amps, over 100 amps give or take the efficiencies and surges.  YES IT TAKES >100 amps at 12VDC if you want 1000 watts out!  This means HEAVY wire to your batteries.  Notice I said batteries.  You can wire more than one in parallel (all positves touch, all negatives touch, AND *NO* positive touches any other battery negative such as in 24V battery systems) and you can divide the load - 2 batteries in parallel and your 100 amps is only 50 amps per battery.  With 4 it's only 25 A per battery.  Think lots of matching batteries.  A hidden \"PRO\" here is that the connector for the heavy cables is up to the task and won't fry when you run 100+ amps through it for hours at a time.  Most inverters lack such a heavy duty connector.  This unit can run 1000 watts continuous which means 100 amps continuous - be sure your wiring is up to the task or it may melt.  You'll want #2 to #2/0 cable to wire this up which is between $2-$8/foot.This is simple power conversion theory and regretably there isn't anything you can do about it except add more batteries to your battery array if you intend to pull 1000 watts for an extended time.  If you seldom need the full 1000 watts or 1500 watt surge rating, then you can use smaller wire, but keep the runs short.There is alot to like about the Xantrex design.  If the only thing you ever intend to run is an incnadescent light and a computer,  then the cheaper \"sorta sine wave\" inverters (they have many names but are not \"TRUE\" sine wave designs) will work fine, but don't use a modified sine wave to run any of the following \"delicates\":+ wall warts (with transformers - they burn up from harmonics+ microwave ovens (they have transformers too and use alot of power)+ VCRs / DVDs / HiFi (clocks will be wrong and you'll get audio buzz)+ some TVs (some do work on square wave but with shortened life span)+ expensive stuff (is it worth it?  Save a couple hundred and ruin it?)+ clocks (they see time going by twice as fast without a pure sine wave)+ flourescent lamps (the coil ballast types get really hot and blow their fuse on modified sine wave power)Of all the options out there for a pure sine wave, Xantrex has the best name and amazon has [revised: HAD] the best price according to froogle and pricewatch.Be sure and buy some heavy guage wire to connect the inverter unless you have a low power load.  If you run 1000 watts through your cigarette lighter it will blow a fuse.  If you put the wrong fuse it it will melt the wire!  Run your wires to the battery.With this inverter you can take your electrical outlet with you on the road or when the power fails have a backup source until your batteries die.  A deep cycle marine battery typically will run 100A for 1 hour (or 1000 watts) so you must conserve if your runtime is important or else add batteries.  Either way you'll love the clean power, no buzzing, dimmers working normally, and nothing being damaged.  Short of a generator, which it is NOT, it is the best way to get AC power away from the utility grid such as solar and wind power systems, off grid living, or car outlets with clean 120 VAC.  Just be sure you have a way to charge your batteries - that is left up to you which is incorrectly documented about the product.

It would be better if there available to set the max. voltage at under 14.8V for sensitive electronics on the modern cars.

I have a J900 booster, used for emergency power as well as ham radio portable power, and I recommend that the instructions be followed to the letter for proper recharging, especially where it says \"Do Not Overcharge!\" on page 3. The factory 120 volt AC wall charger cannot be left connected 24-hours a day. To do so will essentially \"cook\" the battery and kill it in short time - you have to follow the user's manual very very carefully to prolong battery life (unfortunately it is very easy to forget to disconnect the battery after a 4-hour charging period). As a suggestion, you can charge the battery about once a month for about 4 hours to keep it charged - if you remember to do so. Fortunately, there are regulated \"smart\" chargers for sealed lead-acid batteries that can be left hooked up all the time (you may have to change to a cigarette lighter plug) as they sense the current draw of the battery and adjust to the charging requirements at that moment - the result is that your battery is kept at a state of full charge and can last many years. I bought my \"smart charger\" from allelectronics.com as well as replacement sealed lead-acid batteries. In any event, do NOT use an automotive (wet-cell) lead-acid battery charger to charge these sealed (gel-cell) batteries unless you are sure of the charging characteristics of this kind of battery and the charger and know what to do.Hope this info sheds some light on why this and other similar boosters seem to fail earlier that expected, and what you can do about it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "How to Prolong the Life of the J900", "unixReviewTime": 1292198400, "reviewTime": "12 13, 2010"}

I am still using some of the ones I bought in 1981 and I think they will outlast me. I have accumulated more and more of them over the years. The reason I bought these is that a whole bunch of them were stolen from my truck and I am replacing them.Here's a handy hint. If you have a pickup with just a single padeye in each corner, what you can do is stretch these bungees along the sides and along the forward end, then you have clip points all around the bed for securing smaller items. Yes, the bungees are stretchy, so you have to engage your brain and don't expect to secure really heavy stuff. But these bungees are really strong and if you get them tight along the sides of the truck they don't stretch out as much as you might think. I have them doubled all the way around which makes them twice as strong and half as stretchy. My bed is 8' long, so it takes a 31&#34; and a 41&#34; bungee strung together to reach the full 8' length, and a 41&#34; one along the third side. And as I said, I double these so my complete setup is six 41&#34; ones and four 31&#34; ones. I also keep a 41&#34; one to use across the rear of the bed, just inside of the tailgate.

However, a friend replaced both of my attic fans with this unit. The original fans were these so instead of replacing everything - we found the motors here on Amazon. Perfect 2-day arrival and installation (despite the difficulty trying to get to the fans that were installed) only took around an hour to replace both fans.Now to clarify. I am not an electrician but I am an engineer and know the home we have recently purchased (with the bad fans) is not vented properly. There are no roof vents other than the fans - both fans are around 6-foot up in the attic but the roof line extends another 22-feet.Just reading that it's clear that there is a lot of heat above the fans which should have had ridge vents. It does not, therefore in the Mississippi heat, these fans run 12-14 hours a day set at 110 degrees.With that in mind, the fans which were in place (Lomanco - the ones being reviewed here) were installed in 2005 when the home was built. (As per the stickers on the motors)My point in this long story is both fans failed: 1 in 2011 and the other in 2014.The original Lomanco fans had lasted 7-8 years in the conditions noted.Now you see why we went back with this brand. If I get even 4-5 years out of the new ones, I will be incredibly pleased. These are great quality and anyone considering the purchase, I would not hesitate.

Typically, you can expect about five years of service, much more in cooler climes.As far as installation is concerned, the attached wire leads are more than adequate for the installation, and the most you may need to do is to take the bolts out of the motor and insert then from the opposite direction, depending on how your vent is built.

Indeed, this muffler does almost nothing to quiet the jet engine-like noise of my Ridgid vacs. (I bought two of them, but I was in a rush and got them locally.)When we are working on a job site, there often is lots of dust. Imagine turning on your vac and having the exhaust blow dust all over the place. Not only does this create an environment that is hard to breathe in, it also spreads the dust over an even greater area. As other reviewers describe, this 'muffler' -- oh, why not just call it 'air-diffuser' -- redirects the exhaust from straight-out-the-back to a circle. This greatly reduces the force of the air.It is true that the sound of air exiting the vac makes less noise with than without the muffler, but the difference is too small to spend any money on.

Used in a garage, the vac is surprisingly quiet. It seems our Hoover upright is much louder. I measured the Ridgid as-is at 83dB. With the 'muffler' on, it was 83dB. There was a difference in noise but not any more pleasant. I figure it's also just another thing that can get clogged and weaken the suction so I'm going to return it.

Peterson \"mozero\"", "helpful": [27, 27], "reviewText": "After spending more than I care to mention on a bike rack and a hitch-mounted storage rack I felt I needed to protect them with a hitch lock.  The Master Lock 375DAT is for a 2&quot; receiver and replaces a 5/8&quot; pin.  I looked at a few bike and hardware stores and found it to be competitively priced on Amazon.  It also appeared to be of better quality and lower price than some others I found at a hitch store as well.  In assessing the lock I wanted to see how well it performed in three apsects:  1) Fit and ease of putting through the hitch pin opening 2)  Ease of locking and opening with hitch attachments on; and  3)  Did it make any noise or rattle.Overall I was more than pleased with the lock.  1) With regard to placement I was pleasantly surprised to find that it slid through  my slightly rusty receiver hitch better than any of my existing pins.  I think this was because it is a better quality SST than my other pins.  I also found the locking mechanism to be easier to lock in place than the conventional pin.  Since the locking head is symmetrical I did not have to worry about getting the hole lined up just perfect to insert a cotter pin (also minimized knuckle scraps). 2) It was also easier to mount my storage rack attachment since you approach the lock from the side rather than having to  address the cotter pin through the attachment.  I had also intended to use with my bike rack which is held in place with a bolt.  I forgot the bolt is held in place with a nut welded to the inside of the receiver tube so the lock is unable to go through.  Not the fault of the lock, just disappointing that I either have to keep using the bolt or somehow remove to enable the lock to pass through.  3) I was a little concerned that there was some play in the lock and that it might create some noise.  The play I noticed helps engage the key in the lock and does not appear to be a problem.My only complaint is that I wish Amazon carried a version for my other car that has a 1 1/4&quot; receiver which needs a 1/2&quot; pin!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Master Lock 375DAT Snap on Receiver Hitch Lock w/ 5/8&quot;Pin", "unixReviewTime": 998352000, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2001"}

When they discharge, there is a chemical change in the positive plates of the battery. They change from lead oxide when charged to lead sulfate when discharged. If they remain in the lead sulfate state for a few days, some part of the plate does not return to lead oxide when the battery is recharged. If the battery remains discharged longer, a greater amount of the positive plate will remain lead sulfate. The parts of the plates that become \"sulfated\" no longer store energy. Batteries that are deeply discharged, and then charged partially on a regular basis can fail in less than one year.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Batteries work fine", "unixReviewTime": 1240185600, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2009"}

It still won't power the toy out of the garage. I purchased this on 7/26/13. I sent them an email about their return \"Criteria\" which states :\"In order for us to accept a return it must meet out criteria. As long as the item is returned within 30 days in the original condition. Meaning it can not be opened or used. If we feel the return criteria has not been met we will notify you. Please email if you have a concern with the return criteria or question about your order.\"It goes on to explain the refund procedure which also means that once you ship it back, it is up to the company to give you your money back after they perform a test evaluation.  And just for the heck of it my battery number is 1423PM2 in case I ship it back and someone else may get it someday. I am beginning to believe that these companies might sell recycled batteries and don't advertise that.

I just assumed people didn't follow the directions because I know that can have a huge affect on the life of a rechargeable battery.So when I received it, I read the directions and charged it for exactly 18 hours as directed.

I charged it for about 18.  The battery lasted for about half as long as the day before.  I charged it again that evening for about 16 hours (again well within the 14 to 30 window) and the battery lasted for less than 5 minutes - enough for the kids to drive it to the end of the block and back.Look and you'll see there are a lot of 1 star or 5 star entries and not much in between.  I guess you either get a great battery or a dud.

Here are a few installation tips that aren't in the instructions.Before placing the box on the truck, adjust the gas struts to the lowest position. This will prevent the lid from hitting the rear window trim, which juts out on F-150's. There's an adjustment nut at the bottom of each one. The box can then be installed all the way forward. I used regular nuts until I got things just right, then removed them and installed the locknuts (one at a time). This made the installation much easier. The plastic washers will keep the \"J\" bolts from falling out once they're positioned. The instructions call for some drilling, but with a little ingenuity, or a small child to help you, the two front \"J\" bolts will hook into the 1/2\" holes located in the front of the bed. They are long enough, but there isn't much room under there, so the kid can help you get the bolts through the holes and hold them in position.

I didn't notice any damage until after assembly and adding oil and gas. Upon trying to start the unit, the recoil starter was difficult and didn't retract. I then noticed the housing was severly bent due to a sharp blow from the bottom in shipping. Amazon clearly states the unit can't be returned, and a good quick email from them provided me with a phone number for spport and a local service center. Unfortunately, I had been trying that number for 2 days, without success. The eService web site given in a recorded message goes to a page that says their registration expired 6/10. I left a voicemail and a day later got a curt call from a lady who explained they (Briggs & Stratton) made the generator and were responsible for everything EXCEPT the engine, which is made by Generac and they couldn't help me with my questions. (Perhaps if the shipping damage had been to the part they did make they would help?) She said Generac in Florida was handled by Dixie Sales and gave me their number. The gentleman at Dixie was the most helpful person so far, but explained they sell parts and don't get involved in warranty or shipping issues. Generac is impossible to get ahold of, and no one - Amazon, B&S;, or Generac - seems willing to help with shipping damage claims. The B&S; rep told me to get it fixed myself (hauling the 149 lb. unit to a repair center 15 miles away) and file a claim for damages with UPS. The UPS claims form on their website requires shipper information I do not have.So, with much frustration, I went home and pulled the recoil starter off the side of the generator. I put it on a bench and pounded it out with a hammer to the point where the recoil starter would retract easily. I bolted it back on, and the generator started on the second pull. I am very fortunate the spindle wasn't damaged. I may update this after using the generator for a while, but now I am too frustrated by a lack of support from anyone to ever recommend buying a Generac unit. Any later maintence support will be no better handled, I'm sure.The unit does come with a spare spark plug and oil filter, as well as a storage cover.

The longest single use I got out of it was for a week with hurricane Isabelle-it paid for itself.  Other than that I probably run it 30 hours a year.  I use it to power a 1.5 hp well pump, a refrigerator and the blower on my propane hot water heater.  We can shower, flush and eat-the important things in life!  These three things max it out but get us by. It could have a better wheel/handle design-it's hard to move around.  I had to replace the carbureator (water got in and froze up-my fault) and a low oil pressure switch-which collects sludge and just needed to be cleaned.  The filler cap/gas gauge was useless and the low idle mechanism is screwy.  I added a screw-on oil filter, which it didn't come with, although later models do.  It runs like a champ.  If it meets your needs I'd buy it.  I'm presently on backorder for a 10,000 ($1800) watt, 18 hp Honda engine generator.  My suggestion to anyone buying a generator is-get the chart that comes with  generators and figure out in advance what you want to power and buy accordingly.  Good Luck!Update-11/25/12.  Even champs can let you down.  Based on my info. above I must have bought this in 1998 which makes it 14 years old.  I've been using this, lately, in conjunction with a 10KW generator so that I only used the Generac at night, when there was a power outage, to run the refrigerator since it better on gas.  During Sandy (no power for four days) my Generac died-engine runs great but no electricity.  I brought it into a shop and was told the stator was fried and it would cost more to repair it than it was worth-that assessment costs me $50.Update-3/15/13.  After running an ad on CL, to see if anyone was interested in the parts, I received a helpful response.  There was a local guy, Strasburg, VA, that worked on generators on the side.  He checked it out and determined that the coil was fried.  He was able to double dip (varnish insulation-I was told) a new coil and replace the \"iffy\" control panel, used, for $300.  So, I'm back  in business.  I thought it was a decent deal considering that a new generator, of this size, costs around $600.  I've checked the voltages (120/240) and it works fine.It pays to have a backup generator when you consider how miserable life in the country can be without power.  With wood heat that's not the issue but no indoor plumbing when the well isn't working is no fun.

It is fairly quiet and real easy on fuel. There is plenty of power for running the AC and anything else at the same time in my camper. Unfortunatly it is very, very hard to get started in cool weather. I have to remove the air filter and use starting fluid to get in running if it is below 50 degrees. The unit has only about 8 hours on it so far and I hope this will get better as it breaks in. It comes with a extra air filter and spark plug (which I tried changing) but didn't make it better.If it was a better starter out in cold weather I would give it 5 stars on its capability and price. This seems to be a complaint I have read before.  That's a big down fall.Update 11/03: After having this generator for 2 seasons I would like to add that starting has been getting better. I called the factory on the inital problem and they refered me to a local servicer. I didn't bring it in though because he couldn't gaurentee free service and had a 45 day wait to get to it. I don't have to go to extremes to start it anymore but I do have to hold the throttle closed for the first 2 pulls and it will usually start within a couple more even at temps down to zero. Running Mobil one oil seems to have helped too. Overall I am happy with my purchase and haven't had any other problems in about 100 hours of use.Update 9/08 Generator runs great after around 600+ hours. Starts without fuss now in 2 pulls even after sitting all winter. This is the Generac motor not B&S; that I see on some new models. Runs perfect and no oil consumption.

The fuel gauge rattles and could use some sort of damping.  The tank will sweat fuel out the lid if it real full and you move it out into the hot sun.

I bought the last Generac generator from Home Depot the day after the ice storm hit, and I was requried to sign a no return policy.  The generator ran for 3 hours and then quit at 11:00 pm., not to run again that night.  When I tried to return it the next day, I was told by Home Depot that was not possible.  They had 50 generators returned the next day for repair.  They tried to blame it on 'owner error', but the truth is that Generac has poorly designed the generator for cold weather.  In cold and damp conditions (winter basically), the air intake pulls in cold, moist air which freezes after 1 hour or so, eventually choking out the carbeurator.  It thaws within an hour after stopping, and then it will run for another 45 minutes or so (maybe).  The air intake needs to come off of the exhaust manifold like most good models that are more expensive.  This engine is built by Briggs and Straton, and is sold under Generac and Porter Cable (perhaps others too).  Do not waste your money like I have, and do not sign a no return policy from anywhere.  Home Depot knows this problem exists and won't do the right thing by taking returns for defective merchandise.  They told me that Generac advised them to tell their customers to cut a hole in the shipping box, and put the box over the generator while running.

You do all this and your floor will stay clean.  Make sure to have a rag to wipe up any small leak you may have.  Another tip too is opening is not huge on this product so if your plug is on the side of your engine's oil pan take into account that the oil will spray out about 8-10 inches.

If done properly, there is no mess, and the lid/cap keeps oil out of reach, with no exposed oily surface, as the oil drained straight into not just a pan, but an oil container. Fantastic! I wonder why there aren't more products like this.I read the reviews about leaking and debated over this. However, I saw someone who tried windshield washing fluid cap and it worked for him. I thought it was enough for me to bite, as the top lid doesn't have to be tight as long as I transport the thing horizontally to the nearest recycling center. I got it from a local big box retailer as it is a bit cheaper than Amazon, and that I wanted to see it first.I made a few observations at the store trying to figure out why this thing will leak, and maybe pick out a sample that will have a better chance not. The recycled plastic of this pan is very cheaply molded, and all of them have warped large top openings to various degrees, so that the top lid won't ever go on flat, if it doesn't slip off first. There's no hope that it will create a good seal.The drain cap is also plastic on plastic. Though at the store it could be fastened tightly--both the included cap and a windshield washer fluid bottle cap. That quickly changed though when there's oil--both caps leaked (yes, even the windshield washer fluid cap which has a paper/fiber insert as seal), and couldn't be fastened as it would just slip off the threads QUITE easily. In the end I had to put my latex glove over the opening *and* the threads to force on the cap to prevent a leak, and only barely.The smaller drain opening is cut rather unevenly, making it difficult to create a tight seal even with a cap with paper gasket (as in the case of windshield washing fluid. You can forget about the included plastic cap as it'll never be useful). I picked out one with a relatively flat and clean cut, and it still didn't work. Pretty frustrating.The saving grace--for me, not for this product-- is that the 4 quarts of oil I drained out just barely cleared the drain lip, creating little pressure on the leaky opening. I had to do transmission fluid drain as well, and since the cap didn't pass the leak test, I had to pour the waste oil to another container before doing another drain. Not quite the \"drain, cap and transport\" ease that I was hoping for. In fact, it made everything quite a bit messier than it had to be.It's a great concept, but the execution is absolutely terrible. There should have been improvements over all these years (I think this particular product has been on the market for nearly a decade now?), but that's not the case. I hope there's some other manufacturer who can do a better version, and I'm willing to pay a little more for this concept well executed. It's a shame.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Great Concept.

I like the concept of rivets and think they will hold stronger and longer then the screws but in order to attach them I needed a rivet gun.I've never used a rivet gun so I was standing in the aisle of my local hardware store and asked a sales guy which rivet gun would be good for beginners, he picked this one up and said this is the most popular model they have so he would recommend it. I got it and left the store.From an ease of use standpoint, it doesn't get any easier to figure out. Simply drill a hole, pop a rivet in, slide the riveter over it and squeeze a few times. The rivet tightens and pops off.Now I'm only giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because I did have a difficult time with the rivets. I could squeeze but it took a lot of force to get the rivet to pop off. It would be 5 stars if they had a ratchet system or some other way of making it easier to squeeze. But for what it is, it's basic and easy to understand how to operate. I successfully added 14 rivets to my kayak and now have bungee deck rigging securely in place with no concern it would pop off.I would recommend this, as a beginner i had no issues with it.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A good rivet gun, easy to use -> got to attach accessories to my kayak", "unixReviewTime": 1339891200, "reviewTime": "06 17, 2012"}

It seems very durable and almost rolls too good. I find myself having to prop up against a tire to do anything that requires too much force or you simply roll away. I like the casters (or wheels are more like it) and it will roll over cords though I don't recommend doing that.I absolutely love that the creeper and its parts are made in the USA. They even include a little brochure with the detailed list of all the parts and where they are made.The only reason I knocked it one star is assembly. After paying over $100 for this creeper - I get it and had to attached the wheels myself. That blows because it is 16 bolts and 16 nuts. Not hard or anything I just would have thought for $100 creeper they maybe could have done this at the factory.I am 6'4 tall and this creeper is a little short - but then again most items I try to use that involve my height usually are too small anyway. For the average size person I think this would be good.The other improvement they should make it the headrest is a really nice soft excellent quality piece but it is mounted too low on the creeper. You have your head stuck between the two ends of the bone which for me is a bad angle unless you are laying directly below your work and I try not to that at all. I find myself resting my head much more on the actual wheel housing on the end of the bone propped up a slight angle while working off to the side or above/below my face.In closing - I have done the cardboard/blanket and cheap creeper thing --- this is like a Cadillac over a Pinto - no comparison.

It's too heavy - it is a beast.  My old creeper was much lighter and easier to sling around and hang up out of the way.  2.  The wheel covers, or humps, are cumbersome, particularly when it's time to hang it somewhere.  My old creeper could just catch its wheels on the edge of a counter or board and it would stay.  Not this one.

Using these combined with some rubber gaskets and silicon caulk I was able to make a seal that was both waterproof, and nice and tight.

That's not Amazon's fault, that ball Dale Adams Enterprises dropped.When you buy one (I purchased the rough rider) you will notice when you open box it is quite simple. Basically 6 parts. The \"back bone\", and wrapped in separate cardboard 4 completely assembled casters, and one package of 16 each bolts and nuts. When I started to assemble creeper I got to the last caster, and noticed that they put metal sleeves in the wheel opening where the bolt goes through to bolt wheel to caster assembly. An option that clearly strengthens the whole unit which is good...EXCEPT I received one caster assembly that was missing this metal sleeve rendering my creeper useless. I called Dale Adams Enterprises and explained, in which they profusely apologized and told me they were sending a new caster assembly out immediately today. That is great, except I just spent $134 on a creeper that I cannot use. What bothers me is that there are so few moving parts, and how can something like this be simply overlooked? I bought this because it is very high quality as far as construction of unit, and also because of the fact it is proudly made in the U.S.A. When you get it, you get a little pamphlet that shows all the sub-contractors that are involved with the construction of the creeper along with a little brag about made in U.S.A.... which is also fine with me. But when they show the multi-million dollar facility and Dale Adams showing off his car restoration facilities, I hope they realize that they need to sell a good, complete product or they won't have jobs, or a multi-million dollar facility to brag about Made in U.S.A. for very long.

They're inexpensive, but as others have mentioned, they suffer from an inadequate seal.  Old fashion analog gauges have a good rubber seal on the inside that the MS-4000GB lacks.  In fact there is no rubber at all.  Because you're pressing plastic (the gauge) against metal (the tire air stem), you must hold it perfectly flush or air will escape, making a reading difficult to get.  To me, this is the only thing wrong with this great tire gauge.  I've looked everywhere and haven't found a better digital gauge.Accutire should have used a good rubber contact, but my guess is because rubber wears out faster than plastic, they wouldn't have to worry about as many warranty returns.HOW TO IMPROVE IT:Get something called \"rubber tape\".  You may need to buy this online or you might be able to find it at your local hardware or electronics store.  I used \"3M Scotch linerless rubber splicing tape\".  The thickness is important.  I used .03 in. (.761mm).  I wouldn't go any thicker.  Get something thinner if you can.  You don't want to make it any higher than the gauge's white airhole center nipple.All you need to do is cut it to the diameter of the inside of the gauge's mouth, then cut out a small hole for the air hole.  It doesn't have to be perfect, but the inside hole should be more perfect than the outside.After performing this simple modification, my gauge was about 5 times easier to use and gave perfect readings.

The plastic tip does not create a good seal on the valve stem and It usually takes me 2 sometimes 3 times to get an accurate reading.  I think this could be avoided if the tip was metal.  Also, there is no bleeder valve, so if you're tires are overinflated, you need to do more work.  I personally use the Accutire MS-4021B which I find far superior and it's way cheaper.  Strangely, it's cheaper but more ergonomic and practical as it has a nice thumb rest to help you get a better reading and it also has a rubber grip.  Personally the best gauge from experience is one of those analog ones that have a built in bleeder and have a filler chuck so you can fill the air through the unit and bleed off whatever you don't need.  Trust me it saves you a lot of time.  But if you insist on one of these digital gauges, I recommend the Accutire MS-4021B.  It's cheap, it works, and it's more practical.

After searching on Amazon, I found two digital gauges that looked good:  the Accutire MS-4000B and the Campbell-Hauschild AU1102.  They both sounded good, although I was a little troubled by some of the reviews of the Accutire.  I decided, since we have two cars, to get one of each, so I could keep one in each car.  I have now experienced a couple of weeks of use, during which I have had the opportunity to employ a tire gauge more than usual due to \"operator learning curve\" problems associated with setting up the on-board tire pressure sensor in a new Toyota.  (How do those things work, anyway?)  The bottom line is:  get the Campbell-Hauschild.The Accutire looks cool and comes in a nice case.  It has a convenient pocket clip.  But doesn't work all that great measuring the air pressure in your tires.  I experienced the sealing problem reported by others.  It's not that big a thing, but you do loose a little air every time you take a reading.  I will try the rubber tape suggestion made by another reviewer, but the C-H seals perfectly right out of the box.  The Accutire reads a pound lower than the C-H and my old analog gauge.  Maybe the other two are the ones that are \"off,\" but . . .  On several occasions, the Accutire did not give a reading - just displayed \"0.0\"  The C-H always sealed completely and gave a believable reading.  The Accutire is easy to use, all you have to do is push it against the valve stem and it turns on and gives a reading.  The C-H has to be turned on with a button before pressing against the valve stem.  The C-H has a tread gauge that also serves to depress the valve; the Accutire doesn't have any kind of nipple or anything to let air out of the tire if it is over-inflated.  With the experience gained using these, at this point I would buy the C-H rather than the Accutire.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Compared Two Gauges", "unixReviewTime": 1119052800, "reviewTime": "06 18, 2005"}

You get better Gas Mileage using properly inflated tires2. You're vehicle will give you a smoother, more comfortable ride3. You'll have better control, handling and be less likely to have a blow out (underinflation can lead to an accident). In Short: You'll be safer.So obviously, I like to check my tire pressure about once every other week, and before any trip of an hour or more (or any trip that involves high speed driving on an expressway for that matter). So obviously I was searching for a tire gauge.I read all the reviews before purchasing this digital Tire Gauge. I liked the idea of a Digital Tire Gauge with a backlit LCD Display that I could carry with me in my car. It's compact size means it can go right in the glove compartment. The fact it's DIGITAL means greater accuracey. Traditional, cheap gauges are difficult to use and read - with this you get a clear reading without any squinting to guess whereabout the needle is. The backlit display means you can read it easily, even in the dead of night on a country road. Further more a lifetime lithium battery, and the promise of reliabillity and a 5 year warranty also influenced me to buy this.To most of those ends, this product works very well. It appears to give accurate readings (I haven't used it enough yet to really tell you how accurate it is, but the company claims it's very accurate and this appears to be so). The backlit display is nice and bright and easy to read. There's a clip for ease of carrying. It's got a nice look to it as well. It's also extremely simple, no on or off switch just put it to the tire nozzle and you get your reading then it shuts itself off. Nice right?Well while overall, Im pleased, I do have a few complaints. First the company sucks. There is no phone number or website where you can contact the manufacturer if you have a problem. Also that amazing lifetime lithium battery... well if that sounds too good to be true then you'd be right! When you read the manual it clearly says the lithium batter should last a very long time, but will eventually die - at which point they will replace it, but you have to mail it to them! And you cant call them, they dont give you a number! So basically you send them the gauge and pray you get it back... I dont like that deal much. Also they dont tell you there's also 2 other button cell watch batteries that are in the unit. These will need to be replaced every now and then but only are necessary for the backlight display. The unit works fine without them, but the backlight is really handy in the dark, so you'll likely want to replace them.The body of the unit is also inherently flawed. The battery compartment is attached via a VERY tiny screw. Good luck getting it off, even my eyeglass repair kit screw driver was too big! What's more the middle section is little more than an alluminum sleve. This comes right off without any effort and to get it back on you must take out the screw on the battery compartment. This is hard to explain unless I could show you... but you'll see what I mean if you buy one :) I simply solved this with a few drops of super glue... problem gone!The last little gripe is that it can be a wee bit difficult to get a good seal. It's not a huge deal, but occasionally I seem to have to try a few times before I can get a good reading because it doesnt always seal perfectly the first time.A few minor complaints... but that's ok. It didnt cost a fortune, and it does serve it's purpose. If it were made by a better and more commited company, didnt have that little design flaw with the body sleve, and could get an improved valve stem this product would probably get a very solid 5 stars.

First is obtaining a good \"seal\" between the gauge and the valve stem. The Accutire obtains a good seal far more quickly. The quality of the Accutire's head is far superior to the head of the stick-type gauges (... the manufacturer can spend a little more for a better head). Also the size of the Accutire allows you to hold it more firmly and position it more securely on the valve stem. Second is reading what the gauge tells you. With the old stick-type gauge, you have to ponder, \"Is that 33 psi or 32? Wait, how many tick marks are covered up inside the stick? Oh, It's actually 35 or 34 psi. Well I guess it's 34.\" Clearly, not a problem with the Accutire; the digital display tells you immediately.The case that the Accutire comes in is pretty nice. Mine is a silver-metallic plastic with a solid feel (your mileage may vary).

The tire gauge still works very well, and shows its readings in 0.5 psi increments.  As advertised, the large digits are easy to read even in direct sunlight (I just verified that last week!).  It works fine even as I'm nearing the fifth year of owning this handy item.  It even looks brand-new because the case keeps it safe from scratches, dents, and dings that you are bound to get while it is stowed in the glovebox.One thing that should be noted: people complained that it's hard to get a good seal to get a consistent and accurate reading.  I bet it's because the tire's air nozzle was up or off to the side; I find that it's best when the nozzle is around the 6 or 7 o'clock position so that I can firmly press the gauge straight down.  This means you have to crane your head a bit to read the digial measurement, but the important thing is to be able to press down straight & hard onto the tire's nozzle.I've been using this gauge to check the tires more frequently since the season is changing, and also because I am on the road for longer periods of time.  If not for anything, checking the air pressure makes me take a good and up-close look at the tires, and make sure that everything seems okay.  At every check-up, this tire gauge was easy to use.  I'd definitely buy this again, perhaps as a gift to someone who drives a lot, or as a replacement for myself if needed.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "a sturdy and easy-to-use tire gauge", "unixReviewTime": 1111017600, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2005"}

Now, with this gauge I can have a better lecture when I put air into my car tires.  This is helpful since most of the times you need to have the recommended pressure on your tires according to the car or tire's manual.  It has a nice hand grip, very easy to use and it measures pressure is in 0.5 psi incremental.  I do recommend it for those out there who are looking for a more precise measurement, instead of using a manual gauge.

Who knows.Having checked all of the open box units (the newer shipments were sealed in plastic blister packages), I bought the one without the abnormal symptons.

Thank goodness for their generous refund policy at this store.Tests were conducted on one cold tire.

It does what it is supposed to do, but buyers need to be very aware of it's limitations or they will be returning it like I did. First of all, Amazon lists the working range of this unit as .5 to 16 feet. However, the instructions in the box indicate that you should have at least 18 inches in front of the device to work with, with three open feet on each side. I tried parking a car within about 9 inches of the sensor and reset the range per the instructions. When driving up to the unit it gave me a red light to stop at around 16-18 inches...with about 6 inches of car hanging out of the garage! I thought maybe the calibration was off, so I brought the car to within a few inches of the sensors, reset the range, and lo and behold the red light came on at 16-18 inches again. This device is useless in close quarters.The second issue has to do with many cars having curved front bumpers (like our Quest mini-van). Because of this it's important that you have at least 6-10 inches of \"play\" in your garage or you might find that one day you don't line up correctly with your curved bumper and leave the rear of the car in the way of the door again. Combine those two factors and you will need to make sure you have at least a significant amount of room to work with.

From that point, the lights would react as they are supposed to.I also find that you have to drive very slow in order for the ParkZone to work properly.  The times I drove in a little too fast, I would typically get no response at all.After adding my modifications, I find the accuracy and response of the unit to be exactly the same as before I made the changes.My final conclusion is that while this unit does what it says, it's not quite as accurate as one would wish for.

First of all, you need a mounting location in front of the vehicle at about the same level as the license plate.  The device would not reliably detect the car at other elevations.  When mounted at the level of license plate for the Toyota, at first it would not work.  Then I discovered that the license plate was slightly bent.  I straightened the license plate so it was directly facing the device and it would then work.  Also, you cannot locate anything such as shoe racks or cabinets near the device since they seem to disturb the sound pulses from the device.  I think the device would work better on a SUV or van with a large front grill.  Also the green light is very dim compared to the red and amber light.

{"reviewerID": "A3LX221QR362C1", "asin": "B00005AXI7", "reviewerName": "Steven Pemberton", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "(This review is for the battery powered model)  In 2001 I bought two Park-Zone PZ-1100 battery powered devices, one for each of my cars.  To this day they work flawlessly.  The batteries last about a year.  In 2008 I bought a new PZ-1100 for my mother, but it didn't work correctly it had all the symptoms described by other reviewers - green light never comes on, yellow and red only occasionally.  So I tried another new one, exact same symptoms.  Then I noticed a visible difference between the new units and my older units.  The current PZ-1100 has two 1/2 inch ultrasonic speakers, whereas my older PZ-1100 had a single one inch speaker.  I also noticed a slight change in the company name; the original single speaker models were made by Measurement Specialties in Fairfield, NJ.  The newer dual-speaker models are made by Measurement LTD, Inc. in Parsippany, NJ.  I suspect there has been an ownership change.  I decided to try and find an older Park-Zone like my original units.  I found several people selling the older version of PZ-1100 which has the single speaker.  You can tell whether it's the old or new by the photo on the box.  Even though the boxes look identical, if you look closely at the picture on the box you can see if the transmitter has one or two speakers.  I recently purchased a single-speaker PZ-1100 and it works great just like my original units. I bought another one from a different seller and it also works great.  I'll give one to my mother and keep the other as a spare.  In case anyone is tempted by the AC powered models, check out their user instructions and you'll discover that if the power fails it will not automatically switch to battery power, so you will lose your settings.  I briefly lose AC power several times a year so for me the battery powered model is actually more reliable.  And no you won't crash into your wall if the batteries go dead, because either you'll see a flashing red light as you enter the garage, or it will be completely dead.  Either way when you don't get that reassuring green light as you enter your garage you'll know you have to park it the old fashioned way this time.  Since that only happens about once a year it's not a big deal. ***Updated 2-21-09*** Another reviewer (Theseus on February 7, 2009) made an excellent point that Park Zone isn't designed to get you within inches of your wall, since the mimimum range is 1.3 feet.  As long as that's not your situation, I find that Park Zone very accurately places my cars in the exact spot every time, giving me the exact clearance that I want at both the front and rear of my cars.  Before Park Zone I was always worried that I hadn't pulled my car far enough into the garage, but with Park Zone I don't even look when I close the automatic garage door, after several years of use it has never put me in the wrong spot.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Find the previous single speaker model, those actually work", "unixReviewTime": 1232150400, "reviewTime": "01 17, 2009"}

I immediately went to unplug it and guessed what? IT'S STUCK! I gave it a hard pull, and the stupid plastic tip broke, leaving my battery bleeding out like a stabbing victim.  I ended up cutting the inverter's cord to bypass the antitheft system, then after yelling with my wife for not know to how to use the auto headlight mode, I duct-taped it back so I can salvage my $25.

This is the best design I've seen so far for a power inverter. First, it has two inputs which is great. This way I can plug my laptop in and still be able to charge...a cell phone, or run another electronic device such as a portable DVD player. Another solid feature is the internal fan. This enables the unit to stay COOL. Other inverters I've had get so hot, you can barely touch them, which probably led to their malfunction in the first place. The other great feature is that the fuse for this device is EXTERNAL. Which means if it blows, its easy to replace. The last couple I've had have died and the fuse was the culprit, but since it was internal, it wasn't a simple fix. So thats a great design innovation on this one. Its also good that the power inverter comes with battery clips too..this way you can run it from the car lighter or the battery direct.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Solid & Smart Design", "unixReviewTime": 1224547200, "reviewTime": "10 21, 2008"}

Others have written bad reviews saying it wouldn't stop making a beeping/buzzing noise, which caused them to either return it or stop using it, but they must not have read the instructions.  This thing beeps/buzzes for a reason...it is a warning to let you know that either something drawing too much power is plugged in, or it is unable to draw enough power from your battery (meaning your battery is about to go dead, or if the car isn't running, which means your alternator isn't constantly recharging it reducing the amount of power it kicks out).  Whatever the situation is, it doesn't just beep/buzz for no reason.My one and only complaint about this inverter how far the outlets are spaced apart...an extra inch between would have been great because I have to use an extension cord to plug the speakers in (can't fit 2 things plugged in if one of them has a chunky adapter).

Our Dodge Stratus battery was completely dead due to interior lights being left on. There was no glow from any interior lights. It was completely out of current and had been for several days. The temperature was 15 degress, it was snowing out and the car was parked so there was no way to get close enough for a traditional jumpstart (would have needed at least 20' jumper cables).I plugged one end of the Wagan device into the cigarette lighter of the \"running\" car and the other end into the dead car. The \"red\" light on the device went on as expected. I waited about 10 minutes in the comfort of the warm running car and the green light on the device went on signifying that the battery was charged. I tried to start the dead car (it was only 15 degrees and snowing)and it only cranked over once and quit. I plugged the Wagan in again and noticed that the green light on the device stayed on so I unplugged it from the cigarette lighter and plugged it in again. It then went red. After 10 minutes it again went green. I didn't try the dead car this time but rather unplgged the cord and plugged it back in again and waited 10 minutes for the green light to come back on.  This time when I tried the dead car it sprang to life and ran fine. It took 30 minutes for the whole process but it did work!This system has enough cord length for about 18 feet and will fit through a partially opened window so there is no need to open the hood or get at the front of the car. This system allows a person to jumpstart it from any angle so long as the the cigarette lighters of the 2 vehicles are within 18' of each other.Remember - You must turn the key of the dead vehicle to the \"accessory\" position for the cigarette lighter to be able to pass current through the cigarette lighter sockets.The beauty of this system is that any car can be jumpstarted this way. Many of the new cars don't have accessible battery connections. You don't have to know how to jumpstart a car. You don't have to know how to even open the hood. It is safe (no battery explosions or getting corrosive chemicals of hands or clothes)and can be done by anyone, regardless of mechanical knowledge.I was able to jumpstart a completely dead car in 15 degree temperatures, in a snow storm with getting dirty or cold in about 30 minutes.  Doing a traditional jumpstart would have meant getting dirty, opening the hood and having snow blow into the open engine compartment. Getting the engine compartment wet with snow (or rain) can compound your problems!Every car should have one of these devices for the occasions when jumpstarting using conventional cables is not possible, practical or available.

Then I pulled my other car BEHIND the dead car, hooked up a multimeter on both car batteries, *****turned the key to ACC on the donor car (otherwise NO CHARGING)*****, and started charging.  The circuitry actively &#34;pushes&#34; the juice from donor car to dead car, so it's not just an equalization between batteries.I think there is some sort of timer or energy meter in the circuitry that signals you when the unit thinks you've been hooked up long enough, but it's arbitrary and only a suggestion.  The LED turns from red to green.  Likely a voltage trigger is hit and it turns the unit off, but that does not specifically mean there is enough amperage available to start your engine.  When a battery is charging it can get up to voltage without actually being charged, if you unplug it then, the voltage will likely drop and balance out to match the available amperes over a short time.  This is especially true in the cold or if you have dead cells or need to put distilled water in your battery.I had to perform the process twice as there had not been enough energy transferred to start the dead car's engine on just one cycle.  I saw this in other people's posts and I just wanted to see it myself so I can act accordingly.  This is perfectly fine.  Just be warned that this is normal and fine.  I have a large battery in the dead car, so this is understandable.  It did turn the engine over a bit, so that's a good sign.  After the 2nd time it started right away.NOTE:  jumper cables transfer a LOT more juice very quickly, 100's of amps; you can normally jump by working directly off of the other car's battery if your battery is not completely depleted.  This unit will not let you jump directly from another car's battery- it charges your battery.  Your cigarette lighter adapter only lets 10 amps or less juice to charge your battery (10 amp fuse, 10 amp wiring), so be patient.  If you can't easily reach your battery when you raise your hood, this product is for you.  If you have easy access to your battery, then buy some jumper cables and learn how to use them.  It is not hard.I wanted this for my on/off road adventure motorcycle because I go on long multi day camping trips and need a way to overcome almost anything that could go wrong.  I bring everything I need to get the bike back on the road or survive a problem without anyone's help except for the people in my group.  Usually, there's just one other person with me, and we can share the load of tools and supplies if we are careful.  I installed a couple 12v lighter adapters directly wired to the battery on my motorcycle for this purpose, and to power just about anything.  This charger is larger than I would like to carry in my motorcycle luggage- the yellow core section is about the size of a flattened softball but rather light.  The cables are plenty hefty but rather heavy.This unit would be great for a car.  I gave it to my wife's car and may borrow it for motorcycle trips of I don't find a smaller solution.  Her battery is hidden behind her front bumper so you need a lot of tools and time to jump start directly on the battery.In the end, this is a great product for use in specific situations.  You need to practice using it once or twice to make sure it will work in your car.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Simple and effective- but completely in spanish.", "unixReviewTime": 1382832000, "reviewTime": "10 27, 2013"}

Lawler", "helpful": [33, 38], "reviewText": "I was surprised when I tried this out finding it \"pumps\" power from the \"source\" car into the \"dead\" car.  I assumed that this would let the power thru from the source (which is at a higher voltage) to the dead one & slow/stop the flow of power if the voltages equalized, but it doesn't.  It continues to draw on the source to feed power into the dead one (even if it makes the source drop to under 12V while the dead one gets raised to 13+V which I saw on meters hooked up on both ends).  I also tried hooking this up to a small battery to charge it and it had it at 17V pretty quick, so it doesn't regulate the voltage (over 15V is considered overcharging most batteries, but this is intended for brief use).  Also the first time I tried it, it didn't begin charging (although I had it plugged in) until I started the good car. I'm not sure what held it back initially & triggered the change, but it's instantly started charging when I plugged it in ever since.Otherwise I think of this as a 5 amp battery charger that plugs into another car instead of your house (it pulls ~8 amps from the good car while putting over ~5 amps into the \"drained\" one).  It can't pass enough power to instantly crank an engine if that's what you think when you see \"jump start\", so don't expect that from anything connecting to a cars lighter outlet.  The \"dead\" battery still must hold a charge or if it won't, you will need heavy jumper cables.  The wires on this are at least 14 gauge and ~15 feet long, so it's not cheaply built (I've seen similar units with only 5 foot wires for about the same price or another going for $35+).  Also FYI I've heard from mechanics, \"Expect a battery to take as long to recharge as it did to discharge IE: if you drain it fast while cranking an engine it'll recharge pretty fast (from a fast charge source), if you drain it slow from leaving lights on it'll take a long time to recharge\".Also remember that to get power thru the lighter socket into the car with the drained battery, you want to have the key switch in \"Accessories\" position in the dead car.  That's because you want the lighter socket to be \"on\" (connected to the battery), but you don't want the cars engine circuits to be on until trying to start it (since they would be draining much of the charge power coming thru if you left the key in the \"on\" position).  Also you do need a certain plug in the \"source\" car and the other in the \"dead\" car, so I hope the reason for 1/2 of the \"It doesn't work\" reviews aren't from one of those items not being done correctly.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This thing actually \"pumps\" the power", "unixReviewTime": 1195344000, "reviewTime": "11 18, 2007"}

I don't really recall why, other than I wanted to be certain that I had power if I needed it.  I originally was going to purchase a small one for camping, but we went to parks with electric hookups for the RV, so it really wasn't for that reason.  I do recall reading some of the reviews here before I got the generator.  My friends were surprised that I went with a \"off brand\".  We aren't tool people.I have used the generator sparingly over the past six an a half years.  After I put some bad gas in it once, I resolved to start it regularly, which I still forget to do.  You can guess I not mechanically inclined.  I have used it out in the woods to power a small electric saw and splitter.  It works great.  I used it occasionally to power a compressor to run a framing gun and to fill tires on an old mower that simply wouldn't hold air.  Again, not that mechanically inclined.  That basically was its existence, sitting under my deck wrapped in a plastic tarp, for the past six and a half years, until last week.Last week, we had a good snow storm.  We got three feet in a couple days and it knocked down trees everywhere.  This included those pesky limbs that seem to enjoy dangling over the power lines.  Needless to say, we lost power.  We spent the first night in the dark (it was around seven pm when the power went out).  The next morning, my wife snowblowed a path to the generator while I planned to fight with the generator to get it started.  I turned on the gas.  Yes, it was old gas...  I turned the throttle to choke, and moved the switch to \"on\".  I pulled the cord and, lo and behold, she started right up.  I was as surprised as anyone.  Well, maybe my wife was more surprised as I let her continue blowing a path through the snow with a fifteen year old snowblower while I sat under the deck listening to the generator purr.  We dragged it up to the front of the house and I plugged in the freezer and fridge.  Then a lamp or two, then the computer (so the kids could watch a DVD).  Of course I plugged everything into a surge protector.  The generator ran well over 36 hours on maybe forty dollars worth of fuel (maybe fifteen gallons).  I was happier than a pig in...slop.Needless to say, I believe that this generator ranks among the top purchases we have ever made.  I recall it was easy to set up and that delivery was not an issue.  I think I had to go to a freight depot, but I may have imagined that.  I am all set to convert my RV service on the front of my house to a transfer switch.

{"reviewerID": "A3SGQQQGCBS3MR", "asin": "B00005QEW6", "reviewerName": "greg", "helpful": [5, 5], "reviewText": "Like one of the other reviewers I'm a mechanical engineer.  I purchased this generator because I live along the east coast, though not in an area with many hurricanes, so I had time to conduct quite a bit of research before purchasing it.  I work in the generator industry, though with larger generators, so I came into my search knowing more than many, but I was seriously disappointed in the amount of information available on the small gas engine generators.  Most of these manufacturers are not using the web to provide enough information to differentiate their products from their competition or to really sell their products.My main criteria was:  1) Low fuel consumption  2)  Good voltage regulation  3)  High surge capacity.  4)  Good engine with cast iron sleeves.  5)  Potential reliability.  Each of these is important for the following reasons.1) Fuel consumption - Generator burn quite a bit of fuel.  This generator burns a little more than  gallon per hour at  load.  If a hurricane knocked out my power and I ran my generator set for 10 hours a day, in a week I would need 35 gallons of fuel, or 7 five gallon cans.  If you check FEMA and other sites they suggest planning for weeks without power and water after major hurricanes.  This equates to quite a bit of fuel to store (fire hazard) and keep fresh (fuel should be cycled from storage every 3-6 months, maybe 9-12 if you use a fuel stabilizer/preservative) and quite an expense.  This porter cable was more fuel efficient than most generators in its size range, but still consumes quite a bit of fuel.  The only way to reduce fuel consumption would be to purchase a smaller generator set, purchase a diesel generator set or switch to a natural gas powered set hoping gas service can be restored faster than electrical service.  Natural gas and diesel powered generators of the same capacity are both significantly more expensive than this generator (2 to 3 times) and its troublesome to cycle diesel fuel unless you have a diesel vehicle.  I looked over Briggs and Stratton's (B&S;) website for technical data on engine efficiency and there was none, but I did find data on the web that said the most efficient load for gasoline engines is in the 75% range.  Diesels are a little higher, so this number seems reasonable.  Pick a generator set size about 33% larger than your average load for optimal fuel efficiency.  If fuel or efficiency is less of a concern, there are a variety of guides that help a consumer determine what they might want to power, how much power is required, and thus the set size.2)  I was looking for a Brushless (brushes wear over time) generator set that used a voltage regulator to control the voltage.  I couldn't find one.  Voltage regulation is important because high or low voltage can damage electronics and other loads.  The voltage also must be constantly adjusted as the load on the generator changes.  If your refrigerator compressor kicks on the voltage will drop until the regulation system raises the voltage and the voltage increases when loads are removed from the generator set.  This generator set does not have good voltage regulation.  In my initial tests the voltage ranged from 131 volts at no load to 119 volts at 60 % load.  Your utility aims for 120 VAC, so the 131 is high.  Use a surge protector if you plan to power any devise with electronics in it.  In my market research many of the generators advertised a brushless design, but didn't provide details.  I even called the Porter Cable factory support personnel looking for technical information on how this alternator works, but they couldn't answer my questions.  After examining the generator set, parts breakdowns on line, and a textbook on revolving motors I now believe most of the consumer generators are using a brushless capacitor excitation system.  I don't fully understand the electromagnetics of how it works, but it is a simple design and thus cheaper to manufacture than alternatives, fairly reliable since there are no brushes or a voltage regulator, and not very effective at providing precise voltage regulation consistent with Porter Cables recommendation to use a surge suppressor and my voltage readings.  If you want to run sensitive electronics with the consumer generators you can reduce your risk by using a surge protector and not running heavy inductive loads (like pumps, refrigerators, air conditioners, furnaces) while running the electronics.  Porter Cable's recommendation to turn on the heavy loads before turning on the electronics will help some, but those loads switching off could cause voltage spikes and the steady state voltage to change.  Most heavy loads cycle on and off.  Other options include using inverters (a solution that has its own hurdles and disadvantages) or purchase a more expensive commercial generator.  My generators at work have a voltage regulator that keeps the voltage output at close to or better than utility grade level variations, and 4 sets of windings instead of the two in this PC generator.  The extra windings and voltage regulator can produce very clean power when properly designed.  Expect to pay at least a couple thousand for this type of generator and make sure it has an external voltage regulator, but it will produce the best power.  I'm not sure if the standby generators in a box use this type of alternator/excitation system, but a good generator shop should be able to tell you how their alternators work.3)  Surge capacity is important because induction motors have very high starting currents.  Starting currents can be 5-9 times operating current.  My father experienced this problem when he purchased a smaller generator without consulting me and it wouldn't even run his refrigerator.  He later purchased a larger set with a good surge rating and was able to power his refrigerator, freezer, furnace and sump simultaneously without a problem.  My work generators will actually put out 400% of rated power for short durations to provide motor starting capability.  I haven't had a chance to test the PC starting capability yet, but the advertised capability to steady state capacity ratio is one of the best I found it this price range.  Intuition suggests PC tweaked the alternator design to increase the surge capacity and some of the literature I found suggests the engine was designed for generators, so it may also contribute to the surge capability.4)  Engine.  The engine has cast iron sleeves which should improve long term wear.  I've talked with small engine manufacturers and they provided expected lives from 500 to 1500 hours for standard Briggs and Stratton or Honda engines.  For a lawn mower, 500 hours is a long time, for a generator one hurricane/power outage could put 100 hours on the set.  This engine also has overhead valves which help with pollution but also make the engine more fuel efficient.  The engines in this size range have a mechanical governor that keeps the engine at 3600 RPM at the different loads maintaining the 60 Hz output.  This engine appears to be designed for generator applications so I suspect it has a better governor to more closely regulate the engine RPM and thus generator output frequency.  I couldn't verify this on B&S;'s website.  This engine will run on standard engine oil (vs. non detergent in my chipper and power washer) so I can change the oil with car oil already found in the garage.  The Owner's Manual did recommend synthetic oil for low temperature applications, no problem for me as I run my car with synthetic anyway.5)  Reliability.  I wanted a name brand generator to improve my reliability odds, the long term availability of spare parts and the potential quality of the generator set.  It doesn't do me any good to purchase a cheap off brand generator that fails during my first power failure, leaving me again without power.  Harbor Freight and other stores sell generators for significantly less money that appear to be manufactured in China.  Though China produces some high quality products, the standards and specifications to which these cheaper sets were manufactured will not be as high as those that PC placed on its vendors.  If the B&S; engine fails, they have a large dealer network to obtain service or parts from.  Not so with the off brands.My generator came with a bottle of synthetic blend oil, but no twist lock plug ($21 at LOWES).  The fit was good and finish looked good.  Assembly was no problem for me, maybe 60-90 minutes with a bunch of trips to my basement shop.  I didn't like the locknuts they used so I substituted my own washers and nylon lock nuts.  Most of the bolts were English, though a couple required a metric socket.I've done some testing and plan to do more after I assembly the twist lock plug with some outlets.  The generator set ran fine with 2 electric heaters drawing about 3000 watts.  Frequency was maybe 61.4 Hz at no load and down to 59.9 Hz at 3000 W.  I noticed it blew quite a bit of hot air out the side with the outlets and muffler.  I'm not sure if this is out of the engine or alternator yet, or warmed by the muffler.  It was a little disturbing if out of the alternator.  I need to do additional tests with my IR temperature gun.  Voltage dropped as I turned on one heater and then the other.  Heaters are a simple load for a generator to power (purely resistive).  Before I'm done I'll hook up two more heaters and push the load up to 5500W.  I also plan to test it with some of my inductive motors (refrigerator, air compressors, maybe my dust collector if it handles the compressors well).  The accuracy of the 5500 W rated and 9,000 W surge is unknown.  Consumer Reports tested a small sample of generators and found actual output to vary wildly from advertised capacities.  I haven't read their test procedures, but I assume they used the same procedure to test each, so the inaccuracy of rated outputs is supported.  Last time I checked there is no industry specification or set of test procedures to rate generator set performance, so the manufacturers are free to test using tests procedures that produce favorable test results which they can use to advertise their generators.  The Department of Defense has a set of standard test procedures that yield repeatable results between different testers and repeatable performance between different manufacturer's generator sets, but I don't think these have been adopted by the closest to an applicable professional standards association, the Electrical Generating Systems Association (EGSA) yet.  I don't have access to the test equipment to follow the DOD tests, but I have some idea how to find real world loads and I have some ideas and equipment to measure how the generator will perform with inductive loads.  I'll update this post later after I complete my testing.In the past I've wanted to ask questions of some of the reviewers, so I'm going to include an email address if Amazon will let me.

{"reviewerID": "A1Y1DA2CSTS450", "asin": "B00005QEW6", "reviewerName": "Roger \"ByTheNumbers\"", "helpful": [51, 54], "reviewText": "As an engineer, I'm obsessed with numbers and choosing a generator presents the perfect opportunity to play with them. I won't bother you with a lot of technical details, but this is the generator I chose after 4 months of deep, deep researching.First criteria: my needs. I wanted to power a 3 bedroom home with a finished basement through the harsh winters in Maine. Here are the devices I setup as an absolute necessity to power up during an emergency:1) Water well pump, 2) Furnace blower, 3) Basement Sump Pump, and 4) Refrigerator. Here are the \"good-to-haves\": 5) lights in the kitchen and main living room, 6) pellet stove, 7) oven range. And, finally, just the \"nice-to-haves\": 8) TV, 9) microwave oven, 10) computer.  And here's what gets excluded: all the 2nd floor in the house, garage door opener, bedroom lights, everything else not listed above.By adding the must-haves and nice-to-haves, a 5500 W generator takes care of business. One of my concerns: since I have a lot of electric motors to start (well & sump pumps, refrigerator, furnace blower) this requires a good surge capacity from the generator. In case you don't know, a motor takes a lot of electricity to start up, between 3 to 5 times (!) over their normal running wattage. Here's the caveat: not all motors should start at the same time, so then determining what your surge wattage is becomes an \"art\". Consumer Reports simply tells you to ignore the surge wattage, since all the generators they tested started their appliances with no problem. Well, the thing is, they don't mention what appliances they tested and how they started them (manual selective start or just regular use?). So, their point is taken, but surge wattage can't be simply ignored (it shouldn't be the only criteria to buy a bigger generator, though).Well, this generator, with a 9000 W surge, is the biggest I've seen in all 5500 models -- it beats them all. So, this model is perfect for me, as it meets the criteria I've selected above. It even powers my computer and TV (with surge protector) if the oven range is turned off.This is very important: if you turn your generator on, you're in \"emergency mode\". This means, you lose some comfort, some conveniences. You just try to keep the inconveniences at a minimum. Well, if you don't agree with my assessment above, you're looking for the wrong type of generator. If you want to power your entire house and live as if power wasn't lost, you need a stand-by generator, not a portable one. Of course, they cost a lot more money (good and powerful ones start at over 10,000 bucks). That's a lot of money to pay not to be inconvenienced. Now, since you're looking for portable ones (I assume so since you read this review so far), you'll have to give up something. Basically, you can't throw a pot roast party for 20 guests if you lose power; like I've said, you're in emergency mode. Cooking a gourmet meal shouldn't be a priority, order out, get pizzas. You get my point. So, decide what you want to power in an emergency situation.Second criteria: fuel consumption. I was just about to purchase a 7500 W model with 13000 W surge, for about $1,400 bucks! Have you seen the fuel consumption for these generators? Only 8 hours, tops, at half load. This ones rates at 13.5 hours. Well, with gasoline prices hovering at around  2 bucks a gallon, do the math if you run a larger generator for 2 weeks (a possibility over hurricanes and severe winter storms): it may cost you over $500 dollars in gas! Of course, with this generator the cost drops significantly and you don't have to wake up in the middle of the night to refuel it. This is very important to me, especially during cold winter nights.Third criteria: quality of parts and components. I wanted a good engine and a good quality brand name generator. This one meets my criteria. It's not a Honda, but they're overpriced anyway and most home-owners and occasional users won't benefit as much from them. Construction workers, electricians and contractors may benefit some from their cleaner electrical output and \"quietness\", but no generator is really quiet. I ran a Honda once at my house and, sincerely, they're loud too. You just have to work around their noise, it's one of the inconveniences of being in emergency mode. Compare the noise of a generator to 5 kids screaming at the top of their lungs. With a Honda, you have 4 kids screaming at the top of their lungs. My point: 4 or 5, it doesn't matter, they're still loud.Finally, here's what I mean for \"less is better\". If all you want is to power your house during an emergency, there's a good chance you'll be wasting your money if you buy a 10,000 W generator or bigger. First, 10,000 Watts is a lot of juice to deliver and you'll need 50 Amp plugs, cables, and a big transfer switch box if you want to use all that juice. They're ALL more expensive when you talk 50 Amps. The regular 30 Amp already costs money, about $100 for cable (depends on the length you want), $300 bucks for the transfer switch with 8 to 10 breakers (a bit less with &lt;6 breakers, but then you can't power as many appliances), and then installation labor. With my generator, I paid less than $1,500 for everything: generator, transfer switch box (required by law or you're liable, the risk is all yours if you chose to back feed to your house), cable, and labor. With a bigger unit (50 amps), good luck, you're talking a lot more money (I stopped adding up when it approached $3,000, including generator).All in all, this generator is a winner; it powers my house (what I want), it has good fuel consumption, it's also \"lighter\" (160 lbs, compared to 250+ lbs for 7500W ones), and the price is good. I hit literally dozens of generator sellers on the Internet and locally for many weeks, and this one at Amazon.com beats them all. This may change, of course, but I'd still pick this model.Some drawbacks: 1) no electric start. Well, they're notorious for not working anyway, especially in cold winters. I borrowed a generator from my brother-in-law and the electric start rarely works, we always end up pulling the cord to get it started anyway (both his and my generator start at most on the second pull, 100% of the time). 2) No Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR). This means the voltage output can vary quite a bit and may damage sensitive equipments. The manufacturers' manual requires that you use UL listed surge protectors for TV's, stereos and computers. I do that and so far, no problem. Only more expensive generators have AVR's and I didn't feel it was justifiable to pay hundreds of dollars more for one (then you have the fuel consumption issue if you buy bigger! Remember, in this case: less is better!).Like insurance, you hope you don't have to use a generator, but when you need it, you will be glad you have it.I hope you have good luck choosing and buying your generator. This one works really well for me. If your needs are similar to mine, picking this one is a no-brainer.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Less is Better", "unixReviewTime": 1134086400, "reviewTime": "12 9, 2005"}

Unable to get a real person on the Porter-Cable customer service number, I took my generator to the closest listed warranty service shop...after several months of excuses, including no one at Porter-Cable would call the mechanic to tell them how to fix it, and very poor customer service, I attempted to contact a real person at Porter-Cable...next to impossible.  I then contacted Amazon by email to see if they could contact Porter-Cable.  Instead, Amazon arranged to ship me a new unit and take the old one back, with no charge to me....incredible!  Kudos to Amazon!  The second generator operated for three hours (during a power outage) and started to die. Two different warranty service shops, another few months and several pick-ups/drop offs later (during the work day, naturally), I am told it will finally run properly.

These tires need to be rotated frequently to get the maximum life out of them, the front tires on my truck wear \"funny\" if I don't rotate them, probably due to the aggressive tread pattern and the weight from the diesel engine, 4,000 lbs on the front axle empty.  This tool makes a hard and tedious task almost fun.  I only drive this truck when I need to do \"1 ton work\" so it doesn't get a lot of miles on it, I think it only has about 30K on it now, so the lug nuts get a good chance to rust/weld themselves in place between rotations.  The Milwaukee impact has never failed to remove and replace all the wheels on a single battery charge!  The first time I rotated the wheels they had been on about 5 years and I thought that there was no way that this little battery operated toy of a tool would take them off....so I got out my 24\" breaker bar and prepared to do battle, I had been down this road before.....it spun all the factory installed lug nuts off without hesitation.  I couldn't believe it!  This is one of the best labor saving (grunt and sweat) tools I have ever bought.  I already had 8-18 volt Milwaukee batteries 2 Ni-Cads and 6 Lithium Ion so it was a no brainer to get a \"bare tool\" Milwaukee 1/2\" Impact.  I am glad I did.  It exceeds my expectations.

It spun out all the rusted bolts even the axel/spring hanger bolts without breaking a sweat.  I carried the entire trailer out by hand after breaking it down to its individule components.

No chemical smell or suffocating effects if you happen to walk in shortly after spraying. Also, extremely effective with odors. You can spray half the amount of Febreeze or Lysol you would use and still eliminate the odor.Cons: the meaning &#34;Natural&#34; is vaguely defined on the bottle, but simply based on the way it smells and doesn't suffocate when you breath it, I'm inclined to think it's mostly natural. Like all other products, it will leave a non-sticky but slightly greasy residue on flat surfaces when used heavily.Bottom line, we love it and will be buying more.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Much better alternative to supermarket air sanitizers", "unixReviewTime": 1363651200, "reviewTime": "03 19, 2013"}

One must over-spec when purchasing modified sine wave inverters, such as this, because devices tend to use more current than when connected to the power company's pure sine wave that they are designed to use.  How much more, depends on the type of load.  Other than starting the AC gradually, this is a very simple, and reliable unit.  It uses a capacitor to assist with equipment start-up surges, and the fan runs full speed whenever the unit is switched on.I initially had a problem with this it not running my laptop for more than 5 minutes.  The problem was a cigarette lighter circuits are kind of on the edge when powering a large laptop.  For inverters bringing the power from 12v to 120v, I have a rule of thumb that I use.  Take the load in watts and divide by 10 to get amps for the primary circuit.  Example, for 240 watts, figure 24 amps.  Mathematically it would be less than that, but this method builds in ~16% conversion loss, which is just about right.  Cigar lighter circuits are typically fused for 20 amps, and don't mind the voltage drop, but our inverters drop out when the voltage dips below 10v-11v so it matters a lot.  Check the voltage across the DC inputs to see what you are getting.  You will unquestionably need to run a fused #10 wire from the battery or junction box hot wire to the inverter to get the full capacity out of this unit.  That turned out to be a simple matter for me since my vehicle did not come with a power seat, and there was a space for a 40 Amp fuse to power it.

This product is truly universal. But it doesn't seem to have enough power at 75watts and the special power save feature is annoying. It also means more stuff out of your laptop bag as you still need you regular power supply to plug into the adapter. But if it worked the whole flight it would be great. The problem is that it doesn't.It works fine in a car. But I purchased it for the air. On a flight out to SFO (A321) to CLT, I plug in the unit. Then I plug my notebook power supply into that. All is great, the notebook shows AC power and I'm off battery watching a DVD. About 1.5 hours into the flight the unit shows a red light and now refuses to charge. I tried another outlet but no luck. Now my wife is in a seat ahead of me using a regular auto/air adapter with her Thinkpad and it is working fine. But mine will not deliver power. You see the unit has this \"smart\" feature that makes it refuse to draw power if the source supply drops below 11.5WDC. So it cuts off. It blinks and charges for like 10 mins about 2 hours latter. Luckily, between the first hour on power and the battery I am up and working the whole trip but I was very disappointed by how it would stop.On the return flight, again on a USAir A321 it does the same thing. About 1.5 hours into the flight it stops working. And again my wife's cheaper unit is working fine.

The item description indicates that you will receive the TS-2000CK, but what I actually received was the TS-1875CKN. There is not a lot of difference between these, but I feel the seller should be careful to advertise the correct item.The item advertised (the TS-2000CK) has a &#34;High setting of 26 to 2000 watts.&#34;The item I received (the TS-1875CKN) has a &#34;High setting of 26 to 1875 watts.&#34;I received the item very quickly after I purchased it, and when I notified the seller that they had shipped me the wrong item, they did offer to issue me an RMA so that I could return the item. I opted not to return the item for two reasons. First, it was not clear to me whether the seller does in fact carry the TS-2000CK and could exchange it for me. Second, I decided it was not worth the effort to return the item since they are in fact quite similar. I informed the seller of my decision to keep the one they had sent me, and they offered to refund $5 of the cost to reimburse me for my trouble. Because of the fast shipping and good customer service when I had a complaint (as well as the fact that the incorrect item I received will actually work fine for my purposes), I have decided to give them 5 stars.About the product itself: I have used one like this before (the TS-2000CK that I was trying to replace when I purchased this item). Although I have not yet used the one I bought from this seller, it appears to function the same way. I used mine in several European countries, and it worked perfectly. Most useful were the adapter tips (this item comes with five different adapters) that you can use to plug your electronics from the USA in to all the weird-shaped European plugs. 90% of my usage was just charging my electronics, and for that I frequently only needed the adapter tips and not the voltage converter box that is also included in the kit. This is because, although most European outlets run 220V (as opposed to the 110V in the USA), the things I was charging were laptops and cell phones, and they usually come with a power converter that will accept input anywhere from 100-240V. Therefore there was no need to use the voltage converter box - in fact I read that it is dangerous to do so for reasons that I didn't fully understand. At any rate, just check on the power source of whatever you're trying to charge, and if it says that the input can be 100-240V, just use the small adapter tip and plug it right in. I only used the voltage converter to charge my electric razor and to power some other things that didn't accept 220V. Oh, and by the way, the voltage converter makes a buzzing noise while it is plugged in, and apparently this is normal and harmless.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Very fast shipping; received a slightly different model from the one advertised", "unixReviewTime": 1395014400, "reviewTime": "03 17, 2014"}

The capacitors blew out for some reason on the first unit and I replaced the fan once. The new unit doesn't have the fan continuously on so it's silent operation is a plus! The only time the fan starts is upon a power cycle. Otherwise, it has never turned on. It doesn't even turn on when I'm exercising my batteries?? I think it works off of temperature. I have two US Battery 215ah batteries connected in series. Enough power to supply a 1/2 HP Sewage Line pump for about 8 hours or more with a 30% duty cycle. It's kind of a complex basement flood control system but without power in a pouring rain situation, my basement could flood from a powerless pump. This unit gives me piece of mind with it's automatic switch over to batteries. In the last 13 years, my power has not gone out during a rain storm. There's always a first time!! I test the system about once a month via a shutdown of the main circuit feed to the unit. I have a outlet bank installed next to the unit to test the 120vac supply from the inverter. I usually plug in my washing machine and let it run through a cycle. I monitor the batteries never letting them go down below 12.3-12.4 volts. It's enough for testing the system. Overall I'm happy with the new feature of the chassis fan. It doesn't introduce dust and burn out the fan prematurely. You also don't need to listen to the hum of the fan always running. I don't feel it gets hot anyway so it's not needed on a standby situation. I haven't tried to plug in a PC but it seems to power my CCTV DVR and internet router/ network switch on battery power without any issues. The furnace also works fine. It's not a pure sine wave inverter. Some equipment is sensitive to that. You're going to need proper fusing and cables for the battery hookup. Don't mess around with this if you don't know what you're doing. Consult someone who knows. I'm very happy with this inverter and it's a local company here in Chicago.

Searching for PWM Sine Wave often yields Pulse With Modulation generated Sine Wave which is a common way to produce \"Pure Sine Wave\".  Searching for the definition of PWM Sine Wave yielded anything but the type of wave form this product produces.The output of this Inverter is a \"Modified Square Wave\" in that it has a very short rise and fall time that approximates an alternating current and is compatible with most household electronics.  There are advantages to this waveform, first and foremost the output is simple to generate so the product will be very reliable/rugged.  Apparently there has been a shift in terminology over the years to \"Pure Sine Wave\" as apposed to just plain \"Sine Wave\", even \"Modified Sine Wave\" most of us knew was a square wave.My only issue is that I have a medical device that needs to have \"Pure Sine Wave\" to properly drive the heater in the device.  SCR controllers (AKA Dimmers) have a hard time with square waves and the output is unpredictable.  If I had known it was not a \"Pure Sine Wave\" I would not have purchased this product.No, I am not going to return it.

I thought a generator would be too noisy and I'd have to store too many gas cans. I brought this for a couple day power outage at home, to run my sump, refrigerator, and hopefully furnace/blower. But, Modified sine wave is more like a modified square wave. I tested it with a fan, and as some warned the fan ran \"noisy\".  I am afraid to use it with my new furnace, as I don't want to damage the control boards with the screwy AC waveform.  So I'm considering getting a small pure sine wave unit to drive my furnace controls, separately power the blower with this MSW unit.  I think the sump will be fine, the refrig I haven't tried yet.  I also had to buy an expensive Deep Cycle battery.Update Nov 2013:  Here is a description of the 'modified sine wave' I observed with my oscilloscope. It is NOTHING AT ALL like a sine wave. It is a rectangular waveform, with one pulse per half-period. There is no approximation of a sinewave's shape with graduated 'steps'.. The voltage and width of the output pulse varies with the load. The peak-peak voltage of normal 120 Vac is about 344. When running a lightbulb the MSW pulse was 320 Vp-p, the pulse-width was about 4 millisec. Adding a small fan to the load lowered Vp-p to 310 and PW widened to ~5.8 ms. I imagine as the load goes up, peak voltage drops and pw widens to deliver 'same' power.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "not a sine wave", "unixReviewTime": 1329696000, "reviewTime": "02 20, 2012"}

It's good to have excess capacity, if you know your weak-link limits.But this product's only connection is the 12 volt accessory plug-in  (i.e., no way to connect directly to the battery).  And that 12 volt vehicle accessory circuit is usually rated for somewhere around 15 to 20 amps (depends on your vehicle) at nominal 12 volts.  Or 13.6 VDC or so if your charging system is working normally  (depends on your vehicle).Now, in the best case, with that 13.6 volts, and a higher-end vehicle accessory circuit limited to 20 amps, that's, um, not counting all those other real world factors, about 270 watts or so.  Or in the theoretical worst case, maybe your engine is off and the battery is down to about 11 volts and the circuit is rated for only 15 amps (as some autos are), so you can only get about 160 watts or so from that circuit.  And with the efficiency of that inverter being only.... hmmmm.... maybe 85 to 90 percent or so after all the heat losses, what do you suppose would be the real-world maximum wattage of something you wanted to plug in?All of which might mean that your vehicle circuit capacity is likely less than the capacity of the inverter at 300 rated watts. Is it a good idea to plug in a device with a greater capacity than your vehicle accessory circuit if you don't carry around a bunch of spare fuses? Of course not.So, if you are planning to use this Belkin device intelligently, with you need to know the capacity of your vehicle's 12 volt electrical accessory system.  Unless you know it's rated for more, then 150 watts or 12 amps might be a useful limit.  Since this product is rated for about double that, you could accidentally connect something that might fry your system if the fuses/fusible links don't pop quickly.  Belkin probably should have been designed and equipped this product with a separate set of conductors that would bypass that weak accessory system and connect directly to the battery (or maybe the heavier duty wiring that I added that will safely handle over 1000 watts).", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Let's figure this one out", "unixReviewTime": 1376438400, "reviewTime": "08 14, 2013"}

(For example the tolerances are pretty tight between the window roll up mechanism and other components inside the door.  I would advise you to research how other people have done this.)A lot of the time of install is bending the actuator rod to travel parallel to the lock rod. I found this to be somewhat difficult as it is some trial and error and angle bending, sometimes on multiple planes.  You basically install, test, disassemble, adjust, reinstall, repeat.  This can be difficult working in the confines of the door.If this lasts 2 years I would be happy for the price of less than $10 but would be more frustrated with having to take the door apart again.The travel, \"throw\" of the actuator is about 7/8 of an inch, more than enough for my toyota, and the unit has plenty of power to push the rod. The \"clamp\" that connects the door rod to the actuator rod seemed a little cheesy, a small piece of cast metal with three screws to mate the two together.  I used a lot of lock tite on those parts for prevention. I don't really have faith in the system but its working so far. On the front doors and 5th door of my rav4 I was able to mount these where I believe the factory ones are mounted, in holes about 1/4 inch square.  After the fact I found little square plastic anchors at Lowes that seem like the would have worked well for mounting the metal bracket (better than the clip system supplied.)The true test is if this lasts as long as my car, as I believe there is no manufacturer's warranty.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Good value so far", "unixReviewTime": 1207440000, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2008"}

I took my giant shovel and my SnowMover Heavy Duty Snoplow and used one on one half of my snow covered deck, and one on the other half of my deck.  It only took half the time to push the snow off my deck with the SnowMover than it did with the big shovel.  My regular big shovel kept getting stuck. But the SnowMover snowplow just glided smoothly as I pushed. I did break the SnowMover snowplow the first time I used it.  I hit a chunk of ice and the handel detached on one side from the bottom part, and as I pulled back the other side popped as well. It happened real quick, one minute I was plowing and then the next, I heard the pop, and as I jerked to a stop, I heard a second pop.I think they really need to re-think the way the handle attaches to the shovel part.  I'm not good at explaining, but the yellow handle connects to the shovel by there being a hole on each side of the handle and it fits down through the top of the shovel base and is held into place with two strange screws.  I say strange because I don't know what these type of screws are called that have a plastic wrapping on them.  But the holes that hold the screw in place if that hole gets cracked there is nothing you can do with the Snowplow because it is plastic.  In my case both of the holes on each side cracked.  I think the makers should use some type of metal to hold the handle and bottom together.I contacted the seller through Amazon and I was sent a new SnowMover Snowplow right away, and I sent them the broken one.After receiving the replacement plow, two pretty good snow storms hit back to back.  I watched out my window as many of my neighbors cleaned off their cars and taking a very long time to do it.  I waited until they were all done and I went out and took the SnowMover plow and systematically removed the snow from my car in no time at all.  I was able to clean off my entire car with little effort.I'm cautious about breaking this one.  I really like it though, but I think you have to be careful to not snag it on anything because it seems pretty easy to that.  And I don't know if that is a good thing or bad thing.

I was a bit apprehensive reading some negative comments but just had a chance to test it in a snow storm today.  I have a tall SUV.  Clearing 4 inches or more is just impossible with a regular broom.This thing is built sturdy with a riveted head.  If you manage to break it, which I can't imagine how you would do, the company says they will replace it no questions asked.  There are rubber bristles on one side which won't harm your car's finish.  I can just about clear the entire roof standing from one side.  From the other side, it works to pull off the remaining few inches.I was also concerned about the telescoping handle.  Other types of twist-lock handles do not hold up against the weight of the snow and are useless for pushing.  This one has a pair of claws which pinch into holes along the handle for a strong grip at several lengths.In a pinch you could use it for a snow shovel, but it would be better to have a snow shovel.  And ice?  Nah, won't do ice.  I use a spray-on de-ice'r to melt thick sheets of frozen rain.  Here's a tip - ice scrapers made from brass rip thru ice like butter but won't scratch glass.  They're very difficult to find since nobody believes it.  Just, don't use them on curved rear-view mirrors which may be made from plastic.Edit:After just two storms one of the clips snapped off.  These clips hold the telescoping handle at a certain length.  I contacted the company who was very apologetic and shipped a replacement right out to me, no questions asked.  Apparently the clips on the side is the weakest part of otherwise sturdy construction.  They are in the process of re-designing the snow mover to make the clips stronger.  The replacement arrived shortly thereafter.  To my surprise, the clip did not even survive shipping and the new snow mover arrived broken.I really have a need to get the snow off my car, so again I wrote the company and attached a high definition photograph of the defect on both products.  This time the company's response turned a bit colder.  I was told that my photograph would have to be examined by experts and more photographs of the broken part may be required.  They complained about the cost of shipping a replacement to me again and offered they might just offer me a refund - which still would not have resolved my problem of moving snow.To the company's credit, they again sent me a replacement which stood up to shipping.  They may be re-designing the product for next season.  I was told that \"ANOTHER\" snow mover was being shipped and the packing slip had a note to double-check that no defects in the product were observed before it went out.  I was getting the impression that my integrity was being called in question, even after I sent them high definition photographs.My opinion of them went from sympathy of a start-up company trying to overcome initial design problems to a company who is making a defective product, knows about the defect, and is just hoping that customers will accept this.  It's a real shame to see that this product is made in America.  The rest of it is made very sturdy.

I used this to jumpstart my car.My car's tire has a slow leak. I used the air compressor function to re-inflate it. It takes a long time to inflate tires, compared to those 50 cent air/water machines at the gas stations, but it gets the job done and I can take it with me. It works on my Acura's 15 inch tires, as well as my friend's Dodge Ram (30+) inch tires.  (It also has a needle to inflate sports balls, which I haven't used yet.)My Shed has no electricity. I use the attached double lamp florescent light and I can see. (Not super bright, but it helps.)It's primary use, however is for my laptop. I constantly plug in my laptop (Dell inspiron 8600) while in my car. I get power for 2-3 hours. A better strategy to maximize laptop use is: I use my laptop with it's long lasting Centrino battery (last's 4-5 hours). I then shut it down and recharge for 1 to 1 1/2 hours with the Xantrex 300w unit, as it has a standard outlet that I can plug into. I can then use my laptop for another 4-5 hours. Shut it down and recharge it again, etc. etc... Doing this, I can recharge my laptop battery a total of 2-3 times before the Xantrex unit needs to be recharged, and thus I can use my laptop for a total of up to 20 hours!In response to some other reviews: They do take about 48 hours to charge fully, but you can leave it plugged in and it will automatically maintain it's full charge. I've seen it fully charged, which turns the charging indicator light green. Then I noticed a few hours later that the light was amber again, indicating it was 'maintaining' the charge to keep it full.

Hardy", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "BACKGROUNDI got to my dad's place in South Florida after Hurricane Charley ripped through in 2004 and beat all the infrastructure to death.  It first night there was miserable.  That night was candles only, no radio, and had to run my car to charge my cell phone.  The next day after taking a bath in his pool, I looked at his small sailboat, and said, \"Um, dad, don't you have an inverter on that?\"  We pulled it out the inverter and the battery, and that night was so different.  1 light, a small radio, charged our cell phones, and we felt so much better.  It was hot, sticky and sweaty, but we had a light, a radio, and powered our cell phones.  FOR FOUR DAYS!... And that made all the difference in the world.Later, I really thought the experience through, and it's true.  In a real emergency, when the chips are really down, AC and fridges don't really matter.  What you need is security that the world hasn't collapsed.I did the math on consumption to run a compact fluorescent bulb for 4 hours a day, run a small radio for 4 hours a day, and charge a cell phone for 2 hours a day, and basically came up with this unit.  In this profile, this will keep you lit and in touch with the outside world for about 4-5 days.  And that is amazing.PURCHASING DECISIONI bought and tested this unit twice on that load, and it worked both times.  I bought one for all of my family members as Christmas presents.CONCLUSION1) To run one or two compact fluorescent bulbs, a small radio, and charge cell phones for a couple of days, this is an extraordinally wise investment in mental health during an emergency.  For most people, isn't that what we really need?  I mean really, truly, and honestly need?2) One constant light source, one radio, and power for cell phone is all you really and honestly truly need for a day or so.LONG TERM TEST RESULTSI have had the unit for 5 years now, and it still works fine.  Holds the charge, and I still periodically test it under that load.  Live in DC now, and the power went out the winter of 2008.  When it did, I was prepared.  I knew the power would be on in a day or so, so I wasn't that worried.  Pulled the unit out, plugged in my lamp and radio (you need a splitter for this), and was good to go.  Charged the cell phone during the next day.Also used it many times camping to power some Christmas lights around the camp.  That was fun.If you are considering what your needs are, there are so many things this unit is not designed for.  Anything much more, and you are looking at a gas generator.  For the basics, when the chips are truly down, this little dude is really stunning.Hope this is helpful in your decision.

No where in the description does it say it's a gas-powered generator, and these people are belittling a product that they bought because they made a mistake by not researching what the product was and because they don't seem to know the difference between a portable power-pack and a real generator.Now on to the product itself. This is a battery powered portable power unit, first and foremost. It is meant to be mainly used as a jump-start aid on cars with a low (not completely dead) battery. When used in this capacity, it excels at it's job, which is it's primary purpose. The rest of the items on this unit are emergency conveniences, and of course won't hold their own against stand-alone tools built for their specific purposes. The people at Xantrex threw in these few extras for convenience's sake. It has a flourescent utility light that lets you see what you're doing at night, don't expect it to act as a focus-beamed searchlight. The tubes light up bright and will run all night long without going dead. They also put a power inverter on it so that you can power small 110-volt tools if necessary but don't expect it to provide the power of a gas-generator or your ac-mains, and there's a 12-volt cigarette outlet too for 12-volt tools. They put a small compressor on it and it works fine for emergencies, but it's not meant to inflate tires all the time like a Campbell-Hausfield 10-hp dual-stage compressor with 50-gallon tank, it's an emergency convenience, and that's the point that should be remembered.I've been pleased with the reliability of my unit, I've had it and been using for 5 years without any incident. The battery takes and hold a charge well and the unit supplies all the power I need for small emergency situations when traveling or at home during a minor power outage.No, it won't run your TV set, it isn't meant to, but when used within it's meant capabilities it performs it's duties fine, such as running a nebulizer for emphazema medication during power outages, or running a small radio. But if you're needing to power large appliances, of course it won't work, you have to rate the power-source to the power consumption of the appliance, including startup surge capacity. In other words, read the power-rating on the appliance and look at the power rating of Xantrex, if the appliance meets or exceeds the rated load capacity of the Xantrex, don't plug it in, it isn't going to magically supply more power than it's capable of. If you want to run your TV, air-conditioner, hot-water heater, well pump, washer/dryer, dishwasher, home theater system, or refridgerator, then buy a gasoline powered generator instead.

Drilling the 1/4th inch pilot hole and 3/4th inch main hole in solid concrete requires a rotory hammer, not a cordless screwdriver.(3) If your door is hollow, you'll want hollow door mounts for the kickplate and bracket, since the 1/16th inch-thick door face is not thick enough for the provided screws to grab onto.(4) Likewise, check the actual size of your door's hinge screws.

Just buy a $6 50-box of 12 x 2.5&#34; wood screws and you're more than set.(5) The kit comes with a sad little tube of crazy glue to use on the hardware you install in the hole in the floor.

It might as well be a screen door for the protection it offers from a break in.  I installed the Prime Line Prod. U 9539 Strike-3 Deadbolt And Door Frame Reinforcer which does a great job strengthening the deadbolt area, but the glass in the door makes it easy to break the glass and unlock the door.I looked at the various \"kick bar\" and \"door bar\" options that push against the door at the door knob, but those are relatively large and awkward.  The Door Club (and the similar floor-mounted door blocks) was more appealing since it is less obtrusive.I chose the Door Club over the other options because of the relatively low-profile hardware required on the floor.  I didn't want a 1/2\" thick slab of plastic or metal on the floor.  The design of the Door Club is great in that regard.As some other reviews have indicated, installation can be relatively easy, or quite a chore, depending on your type of floor and the tools you have available.  My house has tile floors on a wood subfloor--not one of the best combinations.  Because of the wood subfloor, I chose to install the metal reinforcing plate.Drilling through the tile floor required carbide tipped \"glass and tile\" drill bits for the small screw holes.  I used the 3/16\" bit for the four corner holes in the tile so that the screws wouldn't crack the tile, and then made a 1/8\" hole in the subfloor for the screws to bite on.For the main 3/4\" center hole, the instructions say to use a 3/4\" carbide tipped masonry bit.  I couldn't find a carbide bit nearly that large at my hardware store--only 10\" long hammer drill bits seemed to be that large.  But Home Depot had a very cool Ridgid brand Diamond Tile Drill Bit--it's a thin hole saw with diamond grit.After buying $35 in drill bits (see photos), I used water to constantly lubricate the bit and very slowly drilled the 5 holes.  The holes came out incredibly clean--much better than I expected.Once I had the holes drilled, the installation of the reinforcing plate went smoothly, and my door is now as burglar resistant as it is going to get.I now realize I should have ordered the 'antique brass' color--the standard brass is incredibly yellow and shiny, which I don't really like.  But Amazon only had the standard brass at the time.  But if it prevents a break in, I don't care what color it is.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Solid product, works well.

It won'tt be impossible to kick a door in if this device is installed, but it will slow a robber down and make a lot of noise, which, hopefully, will make him choose another house.  I almost hope that someone tries to kick the door in just so they rip and tear some leg muscles, tendons or ligaments since they won't be expecting the Door Club's resistance.It is easy to install if you have a cement slab.  Basically you just drill a 3/4\" hole into the concrete and then slid in the Door Club.  It gets tricky if you have to install it on a plywood floor since the Door Club comes with a steel plate (probably 3x5 inches) that must be installed around the 3/4\" hole for added strength (it says this plate is optional, but you probably should install it).  In my case I had to install the steel plate under a section of vinyl tile.  So I had to remove the vinyl tile and chisel out a piece of the plywood subfloor so the plate would be flush with the tile and not create a high spot.  Then I had to widen the screw holes in the plate so that the screws would sink lower into the plate so the screw heads would be flush with the plate.  This was more than I hoped for, but still worth it.  For a rug, the directions say to cut an X in the carpet so you can slide the plate under and screw it in to the floor without being too noticeable.  I think with carpet you would not notice that the plate and screws are higher than the rest of the floor (so no chiseling).The package comes with several long, super strong screws for the hinges on the door and the deadbolt strike plate.  THe only problem is that there are not enough screws for all of the hinges.I bought the \"antique brass\" finish hoping that it was actually silver and match my satin nickel locks and hinges.  In the picture it looks like it is silver, but it is in fact a very dull brass.  Doesn't match my locks exactly, but good enough since they don;t make it in silver.[...]", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Install may be a little difficult", "unixReviewTime": 1295308800, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2011"}

The floor insert is hollow with no cap on the end so if you do not have a solid floor or underfloor insulation, you could easily use your new hole in the floor to 1: Poke sticks into. 2: Pour various fluids down it 3: Welcome snakes or various creepy crawlies.I attempted to solve this by spraying expanding foam all up under the house around the hole but it didn't work very well and is still exposed when the door bar is not inside the floor mount.As for functionality, due to the insert sitting on top of the carpet - my door does not clear the bottom lip of the bar, and actually hits the lip of the bar (that sits on the floor) before hitting the bar itself. I solved this by turning the bar around so it is braced by the 2 curved points - effectively losing the 'can open 2 inches' ability.

The physical club warranty is for parts only. Pretty sure I would had had to pay for shipping to repair it. Since I never received a return call, it's just a thought. The actual warranty promoted in the description is for damage to your vehicle if it is stolen with the Club Lock in place. The registration form which comes with The Club that you have to mail (no online registration) requests all kinds of ancillary information, such as your income, auto insurance company, license plate number, and other otherwise personal info that should be kept confidential until needed, in my opinion. I forgot the time period restriction for the registration but you have to include an original receipt for the purchase - no copies. You can question the manufacturer - Winners International.

I was driving 3\" screws into treated lumber and quickly noticed two things.  The driver didn't hesitate while driving the screws home and compared to my standard drill/driver I had to apply much less pressure on the rear of the gun to keep the bit from slipping on the screw head.Size/Weight - You don't notice how much a good drill/driver weighs until you use something like this that is more powerful and yet weighs less.  Though the size is tiny compared to what I am used to, it doesn't feel unnaturally so.Value - though this is probably the best tool I have ever used to drive a screw, it is expensive so the vaulue per dollar isn't what it could be.  If I were starting from scratch on a collection of tools, I would think seriously about this one.  As it is, I already have two DeWalt drill/drivers and will probably not justify replacing them at this cost.Overall, this is a great tool that I feel justifies the impact driver craze that is currently going on.

It's a perfect accessory for fun and recreation.  We used to recreate with just a tow rope behind the pickup, but this here gadget is a lot easier and a lot more fun!My buddy Lucas Tubbs used to work down at the RV repair shop.  They up and fired him for livin in the RVs that was parked on the lot.  When a new RV come in for fixin he'd move his liquor and pot pies into it and stay there till the next RV came in and then move again.  I don't think they'd have caught him neither if he didn't keep takin the RVs out on grocery runs.  He should have known that if he was drivin them RVs when he shouldn't be, sooner or later he'd wind up high centered on top of a pretzel stand in front of the baseball stadium and he'd have a world of explainin to do.  It's just a matter of time and probabliabilities.  Anyway, as he was leavin the repair shop for the last time he stoled all them rollin dolley gadgets that they use to slide under the RVs and brought them back to the trailer park for us to play with.We made up a game then usin these dolley thingies called Bump-the-Bed (it aint as naughty as it sounds).  Lucas or me drives the pickup truck through the park and tows someone behind who's ridin on one them dolley thingies (it's like water skiing without the water or the skis).  I don't get down to the lake much cause of the whole house arrest thing, so this is the perfect way for me to recreate.  Anyway, the game was to drive over the speed bumps in the park at just the right speed, then slam on the brakes.  That way whoever's ridin behind hits the speed bump, flies into the air, and (if you're playin the game right) lands in the bed of the pickup.  You get extra points for doin fancy tricks while you're in the air.  You have an old matress or inflatiated kiddie pool there in the bed of the truck to catch them.  Old cans or bottles work pretty good too.  Except you don't want them glass bottles ... I have to admit that I shoulda thought that through better before loadin up the truck bed with them empty Budweiser bottles.The problem with Bump-the-Bed usin a tow rope then was that if you weren't hittin the speed bump just right dead straight, the person bein towed missed the bed of the pickup.  There'd be too many times when I'd hit the bump, slam on the brakes, then hear this thud right next to where my driver's door would be if I had one.  I don't know how, but one time I actually managed to get my cousin Teeter all the way over my truck bed and into the driver's seat of that convertible FireBird in Clifford McNaugher's yard!  We tried a good 5 or 6 more times to do it again, but that was a one in a million shot and Teeter was startin to act a little screwey so we stopped.  He was yellin stuff about \"Green Sharks\" fightin \"Blue Sharks\" and his left foot kept turnin around facin backwards, so we knew he'd had enough fun for one day.... but I digest ... I'm sposed to be talkin about the Xtend-o-Truck.  Now that we have this Xtend-o-Truck, the person on the back is always lined up straight!  So, when we hit the speed bump he (or she if the girls aint too warn down from the mornin sickness) always flies just one direction: straight toward the truck.  We learned pretty fast that you need to do a little hop right before the truck stops though.  Otherwise you just wrap your bodily middle sections around the crossbar of the Xtend-o-Truck and it takes a day or two to walk upright and propper again.  If you time it just right you can use the bar to sprang up in the air and do some amazin flips and poses before hittin the truck!  I even got a few new dents in the HOOD of my truck from Lucas sprangin off the crossbar just right!Now I should probably say here that I don't condom other folks playin Bump-the-Bed (even with the Extend-o-Truck) cause we're semi-perfesionals at this sport and you other folks who aint as practiced in the finer points of self-pervesation may get yourself gimped up if you was to try it.  At least don't attempt it without propper safety gear.  Wear a cup to protect your vitals.The only complaint I have about this fine product then is that the Extend-o-Truck is sold one at a time, but it's obvious that the manufactuerers intend you to buy at least 2.  It's a little misleading ... like selling only on Bagmitten racket at a time.  You can't fully enjoy the game until you buy the second Bagmitten racket, and you can't play their \"Capture the Red Flag\" game without a second truck and Extend-o-Truck.  Why would they include this red flag if it wasn't to tease you into buyin the second Extend-o-Truck?  One of them sly marketing ploys.  Once we get another Extend-o-truck and Teeter gets his pickup runnin again, we're gonna be off to the Walmart parkin lot to play.  We would play here in the trailer park, but the speed bumps would make it just too difficult.  You'd be speedin along, catchin up to the other truck, reachin out, just about to grab the other truck's red flag and win the game, when BOOM ... SPEED BUMP and you're wrapped around the cross bar of the Extend-o-Truck so tight that they have to pry you off with a crow bar.All in all, a great product ...

If you choose to buy this product inspect all welds and have a welder reinforce any suspect welds. The first time I used the product one of the two 'hooks' on the 't' section snapped (at the weld) when I was securing my canoe. The hooks should be a thicker gauge steel and be welded correctly.2) Bed Extender Function is Useless. The product can be used as a bed-extender or a t-bar/ladder-lumber rack. The first time I used the product I secured it to my truck as a bed-extender. The first thing that happened when I pulled out of my driveway was that I bottomed out - the steel arm dug into my rock driveway. The driveway is not steep, just has a minor dip at the end. After inspection of the damage (a few minor scratches) I decided to keep driving to the canal to launch my canoe. I bottomed out again going over a train track - steel arm dug into the road and stopped me in my tracks. I continued my journey using the ladder-lumber rack function instead. Will not use the bed-extender function again.3) Ladder-Lumber Rack Function Requires Additional Securing/Support. Contrary to the pictures supplied by the manufacturer, the product cannot be simply inserted into your tow-hitch and be used as a ladder rack (unstable & unsafe). The instructions provided clearly state that when used for roof top hauling that the product must be further secured by ropes to your trailer bed to provide adequate support and strength for safe use (not illustrated in manufacturer photos online). Simply done but misleading advertising and the product provides no attachment points for securing. You basically have to attach a rope to one corner of you trailer bed, wrap the rope around the vertical up-right then secure the rope to the other corner of the bed - looks pretty dodgy/tacky.I will continue to use this product (for roof top  hauling only) to transport my canoe but I would recommend any potential buyers to look for another option.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "50% useless.

I have a 2004 Tundra double cab with a 6' bed, 8' if you fold down the tailgate.  Using the Extend-A-Truck to make the bed longer, I found that it worked pretty well.  For 10' lumber, the T-bar is a little too far away, so in order to lash the lumber to the T-bar, your lumber is not flush against the front of the bed.  This means if you had a panic stop, the lumber might slide out from the tie down strap and come loose.  This won't be a problem for lumber longer than about 10' 6\" in my setup.  I recently had to haul a big load of 12' lumber and I had forgotten to bring the Extend-A-Truck with me.  It worked OK without it, but I was regretting that I forgot the bed extender.I think the tie down loops welded to each end of the T-bar are a little flimsy.  I'm reluctant to really ratchet down my tie down straps extra hard for fear that these loops might bend or snap off.  They are only about 1/8\" diameter steel. Their placement also means that your bottom layer of cargo can't be any wider than 4' without interfering with the loops.  An improvement would be to use sturdier loops and place them on the sides of the T-bar so they are not in the way.The two sections fit together alright, but the fit is not that snug.  The result is that the whole rig is a little \"floppy\" feeling until it gets tied down to something.  Also, while understanding the tradeoff between weight and strength, I think the designer erred on the side of light weight.  If there was some corner bracing or gusseting, or if the whole thing was made with a thicker gauge of steel, it would feel more appropriately sturdy.When storing, it is natural to want to nest the long part of the hitch bar through the top of the T-bar.  This works OK, but it would work even better if the hitch pin hole was moved about 1/2\".  As it stands, you can't use the hitch pin to lock the two pieces together for storage.  If you're not careful, the two pieces slide apart.  It seems like it is designed to specifically prevent you from doing this.Overall, however, this is a very useful device, and I am happy with the purchase.

I've had this duster for a couple of weeks, used it on three cars, and it absolutely works wonders. It completely removes the dust on cars and leaves the car looking just like it has been washed. The duster's bristle is soft and thick, doesn't scratch, the paraffin wax helps catch dust, and the duster is large enough to easily clean surfaces. Using the duster is also as simple as it gets, you just swipe the duster over your car, no need to scrub or even rub. It's that simple! I haven't had any problem with the duster leaving wax streaks because I left it on newspaper to air out for 48 hrs per instructions. The dusters instruction also mentioned that there is no need to wash the duster, \"that the dustier it gets the better it cleans\". And from my experience that seems completely accurate. Of course it also states, if you feel the need to wash the duster do so by hand washing it. The duster also comes with its own case, so there is no need to worry about hanging it out in the open. I've been using the duster once every week and it leaves my car looking as if I just washed it. I absolutely love this car duster and would completely recommend it to everyone.Update***After carefully examining my car after numerous uses with this duster, I have to admit I am very disappointed by one aspect of this item. The duster won't scratch the car but it will leave SWIRL Marks! I noticed very bad swirl marks on my and went through an extensive test to try figure out what was causing the swirls.

My grandfather has had one of these for years, but due to a disability he just can't do what he used to. I now take care of his cars as best as I can with the main being a 2005 Dodge Magnum in Grey. The car already has swirl marks and clear coat defects.Initially he keeps the duster hung on the wall inside the garage and it obviously needs a little TLC. Since what I skimmed in the forums for care and maintenance was to wash in cold water with a mild detergent (ex. Woolite) that it should be okay. Sadly I don't have any on hand so I am subbing it with a Meguires car wash solution in cold water.

This duster keeps a relatively clean, maintained car looking show room shiny and takes only minutes to use. How many things out there can give you a spiffy shine in a couple of minutes?The key to using the Duster is to follow the clear instructions provided. You MUST let it dry out a day or two before initial use. It has a waxy coating on the fibers (all the more reason it DOES NOT scratch the finish) and it has to dry out before initial use. Have read a couple of reviews that claim the Duster scratches, but suspect it is because they didn't let it dry out. The one time I forgot to do that, it looked liked it scratched (scared the daylights out of me!), but it was just swirls on the surface from the moist wax - easily removed. And, if there is moisture on the car's surface, it too will look like a swirl or scratch until it dries.Second, it is is a DUSTER, NOT a scrub brush. Only to be used on finishes that are otherwise clean but have dust/pollen on them. If you scrub with it to remove mud, splotches, bird droppings, etc., it WILL scratch, just as dry rubbing a car's finish with ANYTHING will scratch it. You let the Duster do the work, lifting the dust right off the car. Doesn't just push it around, but actually lifts it off.Maker claims it only gets better with time and dirt, but of course can't figure out how that could be true. BUT, have never noticed any problem with use and dirt accumulation. Tried washing once, which maker says you can do, but seems to remove the waxy coating and defeats the effectiveness. Ya, it may last forever, but I buy a new one once a year - hey it's pretty inexpensive.Be the envy of neighbors, get one of these and be as amazed as they will.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Detailers Dream Come True", "unixReviewTime": 1258502400, "reviewTime": "11 18, 2009"}

I did purchase one to try out on those \"dusty\" california days here.  It takes out all the dust, yes, but leaves very fine scratches on your finish.  because of it, I do need to use swirlx and scratchx to remove all the fine scratches it produced.  not so good.  Seeing that I have a black car, the scratches actually can be seen fairly well.  I was extremely disappointed and plan on returning it very soon.I was very VERY skeptical once I saw the giant fibers on this thing.  Now theres a reason why detailers don't use normal towels on their cars -- its because of the bigger fibers!  They use a special weaved microfiber towel to help detail all their cars.  The fibers on the california duster are even BIGGER than normal towels!  How can this NOT scratch your finish.I recommend avoiding it if you car about your car.
